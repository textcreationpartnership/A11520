            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For this is to write God himſelfe the Author of all their vſurpations, and to caſt vpon that <hi>Infinite Iuſtice</hi> the patronage, the ſhame and diſhonour of all their publique Robberies, Oppreſsions, and Violences. The <hi>Pagan</hi> Tyrants of old, though they were not more iuſt, yet they were more modeſt: They had a more venerable conceit of their <hi>Gods</hi> (ſuch as they were) then to entitle them to their owne vniuſt actions And therefore when by plaine force or fraud, they tooke from lawfull <hi>Princes</hi> their Crownes and <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> they profeſſed ingenuouſly herein to neglect Piety and Iuſtice,

               </gap>as afterward aſſailed with a grieuous melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, accompanied with a ſtrong apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of death, which he feared would ſeaze vpon him within a few dayes. This feare was more encreaſed by a rumour diſperſed thorow <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Image of our <hi>Lady de Subiacco</hi> had ſweated; which vſually happens (as the vulgar beleeue) for to aduertiſe the <hi>Popes</hi> that their death is at hand. And further, a <hi>Flemmiſh Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger</hi> had foretold that in
<hi>March Pope Clement</hi> 8. was to die, and that after him ſhould be elected one <hi>Leo,</hi> and then one <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſhould liue but a ſhort time. Beſides, this <hi>Pope</hi> by nature was timorous, and much inclined to giue credit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Diuinations, which he entertained vpon all occurrences and accidents. This perturbation of ſpirit held him fiue
<hi>Months</hi> in ſuch extremitie, that all things affrighted him; in ſo much that he diſmiſſed his <hi>Cooke</hi> and his <hi>Caruer,</hi> who had
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17285:14"/> long time ſerued him; and if any perſons of baſe and meane condition and vnknowne, did preſent him with any memoriall or petition as hee paſſed the ſtreets, very often hee let them fall to the ground, fearing leſt they might bee empoyſoned. Being thus vexed with ſuſpitions, his deſigne touching the enlargement of
<hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall</hi> Libertie was neglected.</p>
            <p>But in the <hi>Month</hi> of <hi>September</hi> after his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion to the <hi>Papacie,</hi> his friends and kinſmen found a remedie for this feare; hauing made a great aſſembly of all the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> and other Fortune-tellers of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the houſe of the <hi>Lord Iohn Francis,</hi> brother to his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> who concluded by their rules that the time of ſome perils threatned by the influences was paſt, and that therefore he might now liue many yeares. His feare being thus remoued, he reſumed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine his firſt and ordinary thoughts of aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the
<hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> iuriſdiction.</p>
            <p>He began to moue the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King</hi> that the
<hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> might be receiued in his Kingdome. In
<hi>Spaine</hi> he procured that the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> might be exempted from paying any Tithes. At <hi>Naples</hi> he wrought in ſuch ſort that <hi>Iohn Francis de Ponte Marquiſe</hi> of <hi>Morcone,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17285:15"/> the Regent <hi>de Ponte,</hi> was ſent to
<hi>Rome,</hi> as puniſhable in the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> for hauing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the <hi>Gallies</hi> a Bookeſeller, for a matter which the
<hi>Inquiſitor</hi> pretended to belong to his cogniſance. Hee tooke from the <hi>Religious</hi> of <hi>Malta</hi> the collation of certaine
<hi>Commanderies,</hi> conferring them vpon the <hi>Cardinall Borgheſe.</hi> He raiſed many difficulties to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> as well for the impoſts which he had put vpon his Subiects of <hi>Parma</hi> in the abſence of the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> as for the fact of <hi>Count Albert Scotto,</hi> and alſo for other things which the <hi>Pope</hi> pretended to haue beene enterpriſed againſt the <hi>Bull, in caena Domini.</hi> Moreouer, he had ſome differences with the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> not only becauſe his Officers tooke knowledge, and gaue iudgement in the temporalty of <hi>Benefices,</hi> but alſo becauſe <hi>Laiques</hi> aſſiſt at the <hi>Office</hi> of the <hi>Inquifition;</hi> but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by reaſon of an <hi>Abbey</hi> which the <hi>Duke</hi> had conſerred on the <hi>Cardinall Pio.</hi> All things being put in deliberation, the <hi>Duke</hi> changing the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon named to the
<hi>Abbey,</hi> placed therein a <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew</hi> of his
<hi>Holineſſe,</hi> ſome what to appeaſe him.</p>
            <p>But none of theſe attempts ſucceeding to his minde, in the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> two occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were offered, not only of themſelues very
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17285:15"/> proper for the end which the <hi>Pope</hi> pretended, but very commodious, as being ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and meanes to open him a paſſage to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter matters. The one was, that the
<hi>Republique</hi> of <hi>Luca</hi> conſidering that many of their Citizens hauing changed their Religion, had retired themſelues into Proteſtant countries; in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they had publiſhed an <hi>Edict,</hi> by which all their ſubjects were forbidden to haue any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, or to treat in any faſhion whatſoeuer with ſuch perſons: an <hi>Edict</hi> which doubtleſſe had beene highly commended by ſome former <hi>Popes.</hi> But this man, after it had beene repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him, approued the law in it ſelfe; but ſaid neuertheleſſe that the <hi>Republique</hi> of
<hi>Luca</hi> had no authority to make any ſuch ordinance which touched
<hi>Religion</hi> (howſoeuer it were in it ſelfe good and holy,) for as much as <hi>Laiques</hi> haue not any power to decree in matter of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, although the Law be in fauour thereof. And therefore he abſolutely commanded that the <hi>Edict</hi> ſhould be raſed out of their Records, hauing an intention to make another (the ſame in ſubſtance) but to publiſh it by his <hi>Pontificall</hi> authoritie. The other was, that the
<hi>Republique</hi> of <hi>Genoa</hi> being aduertiſed that the Gouernours
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17285:16"/> of certaine <hi>Lay Fraternities,</hi> inſtituted by deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had not diſpenſed the Reuenew with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite fidelitie, reſolued to examine and renew their accounts; and to this effect commanded that the Bookes ſhould bee brought vnto the <hi>Duke.</hi> And in the ſame Citie there happened a thing of much greater importance, occaſioned by a new inſtitution of an <hi>Oratorie</hi> of <hi>Secular</hi> perſons, in the Houſe of the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> for <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> exerciſes; wherein they of that <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> conſpired not to fauour any but of their owne <hi>Society</hi> in the diſtribution of
<hi>Magiſtracies.</hi> Whereof the <hi>State</hi> hauing notice, by publique authoritie they tooke order to prohibite all ſuch Aſſemblies. Theſe Decrees (which indeed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the pietie of that <hi>Republique,</hi> as deſirous to prouide againſt the euill husbanding of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall goods giuen to pious vſes, and to preuent all vnlawfull conuenticles and aſſemblies, which vnder pretext of Religion tend to the ruine of <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mmon-wealths,)</hi> were not expounded in the true ſence, nor well accepted by the <hi>Pope;</hi> but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily he was much offended, and gaue the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi> to vnderſtand, that theſe Ordinances were againſt the <hi>Liberty Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expreſſely he enioyned them to reuoke their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17285:16"/> 
               <hi>Edicts,</hi> otherwiſe he threatned to thunder out his Cenſures. Hee made great inſtance to the <hi>State</hi> of
<hi>Venice,</hi> that they would ſuccour the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> with money for the warre of <hi>Hungarie</hi> againſt the <hi>Turke,</hi> offering himſelfe (in caſe the <hi>Senate</hi> ſhould make difficultie, for feare of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoking againſt themſelues ſo puiſſant an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie) to receiue it ſecretly, and paſſe it vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, that it ſhould not be perceiued. In which treatie hee and his <hi>Nuntio</hi> vſed a forme of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, not like as when one <hi>Prince</hi> repreſents vnto another their common intereſts, but like one which demandeth ſome extraordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions from his ſubiects. And therefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome modeſt words of anſwer, at laſt for a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reſolution the <hi>Senate</hi> ſaid, that, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of their <hi>Eſtates</hi> they were forced to make great expenſes, and to prouide for many diffidences, which hindred that they could not apply themſelues to any new enterpriſes; that it was neceſſary firſt of all to ſettle a perfect intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence among <hi>Chriſtian Princes,</hi> to the end that hauing quitted all ſuſpitions, they might (being well vnited) entend the oppreſſion of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemie; that whenſoeuer any ouerture vnto a good Vnion ſhould be offered, the
<hi>State</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:17285:17"/> would not be the laſt that ſhould take armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the enemies of <hi>Chriſtianitie.</hi> This anſwer ſeemed ſtrange vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> as perſwading himſelfe (conformably to the doctrine of the moderne <hi>Canoniſts)</hi> that he might command a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Prince</hi> to doe whatſoeuer he thinkes expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the common good of <hi>Chriſtendome:</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercheleſſe, he iudged not meet to ground his Quarrell vpon this, but vpon ſome other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which (in pretence at leaſt) might be more ſpirituall and trench more neerely vpon the <hi>See Apoſtolique.</hi> Wherefore, firſt onely in generall termes he treated that the <hi>Eccleſiasticall</hi> libertie might not be in any faſhion violated, but rather that iuriſdiction reſtored entire: this was the talke of his
<hi>Nuntio</hi> in <hi>Venice,</hi> and of himſelfe at <hi>Rome</hi> to the
<hi>Embaſſador</hi> of the <hi>Signiory.</hi> After, comming to particulars, hee mentioned ſome affaires concerning Nauigation, and the impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpon oyles, and touching an exchange on the coaſt of
<hi>Romagna</hi> for the <hi>Marquiſate</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cona;</hi> aſſaying by all meanes to make the <hi>State</hi> receiue his commandements. Further, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the reuocation of an Ordinance made by the <hi>Senate</hi> the eleuenth of <hi>December</hi> MDCIIII. forbidding the Subiects of the <hi>Signiory</hi> to ſet
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17285:17"/> forth any Veſſels by ſea, or to make any aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances or companies for the traffique of any merchandize whatſoeuer (to be exported out of the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> into foraine countries,) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe firſt it paſſed by <hi>Venice;</hi> alledging that this would hinder the great importations and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in the
<hi>Eſtate</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent was againſt the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> Libertie. But being anſwered, that euery
<hi>Prince</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands his ſubiects that which may ſerue for the commoditie of his owne <hi>Eſtate,</hi> without conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, what may follow thereupon to neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour <hi>Princes,</hi> which cannot iuſtly be therewith offended, howſoeuer they may be in ſome ſort endamaged: and that whenſoeuer his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> ſhall commaund his
<hi>Subiects</hi> any thing which may turne to the profit of his Gouernment, the <hi>State</hi> would not take it in euill part, nor eſteeme it againſt their Libertie: the <hi>Pope</hi> perceiued by this eſſay that thus he could not compaſſe his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, there being not any ſhadow of pretext, to fetch this controuerſie within the bounds of things <hi>Spirituall.</hi> For this reaſon, ſo ſoone as he could apprehend an occaſion, which might more probably be thought <hi>Spirituall,</hi> leauing the reſt, he ſetled his proiects and purpoſes whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:17285:18"/> The occaſion was, that at <hi>Vicenza,</hi> one <hi>Scipio Sarraceno, Canon</hi> there of a <hi>Church</hi> (who had with great contempt defaced the Seale of the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> which was put to, for the cuſtodie of the <hi>Biſhops Court</hi> of <hi>Chancery,</hi> at the requeſt of the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> the <hi>See</hi> being vacant,) did his vtmoſt endeuour to ſeduce a <hi>Damoſell</hi> his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman; and preuailing not with her, after he had long moleſted and purſued her in publique, and euen in the <hi>Church,</hi> at laſt in a deſpitefull outrage, he ſhamefully defiled her portall and houſe doores with his excrements: for which cauſe, being aſſiſted by ſome Gentlemen of her family, ſhe came to <hi>Venice,</hi> and there put in her complaint againſt this <hi>Canon,</hi> who being called, readily preſented himſelfe. The
<hi>Canon</hi> had a kinſman <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Citta Nuoua,</hi> a man very bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and enterpriſing, who ſerued in <hi>Venice</hi> for a Guide and Counſeller to all the <hi>Nuntio's</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> and by his counſels dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted all their actions; and the
<hi>Nuntio's</hi> had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe order to communicate with him their Commiſſions. By his meanes the <hi>Nuntio</hi> was moued in this affaire, who both by his owne diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was vehemently deſirous to procure for the <hi>Clergie</hi> a licentious exemption, and but a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17285:18"/> little before was come to <hi>Venice</hi> with that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne. The <hi>Nuntio</hi> then and this <hi>Biſhop</hi> ſpeedily gaue aduice of this buſineſſe vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> and to the
<hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Vienza,</hi> who was then in <hi>Court:</hi> who thereupon treated together, and mutually excited themſelues to the defence of the <hi>Canon,</hi> and of the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> Libertie. Both the one and the other ſpake of this matter to <hi>Augustin Nani, Embaſſador</hi> of the <hi>State,</hi> with the <hi>Pope,</hi> a bout the end of <hi>October.</hi> The <hi>Biſhop</hi> told him, that the <hi>Pope</hi> would not endure the empriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a <hi>Canon,</hi> and that hee was by him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to doe the office of a <hi>Biſhop;</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it were good to giue ſatisfaction to his <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,</hi> by rendering the priſoner to the <hi>Iudge</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> the crime being not ſo grieuous. But the <hi>Pope</hi> was much more peremptory; that he would not in any ſort permit that <hi>Eccleſiaſtiques</hi> in any cauſe ſhould be iudged by <hi>Seculars,</hi> this being againſt the ordinance of the <hi>Councell.</hi> The <hi>Embaſſadour</hi> aduertiſed the
<hi>State</hi> of theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, and whilſt he expected their anſwer, the <hi>Pope</hi> againe complaines vnto him in another audience, how that at <hi>Venice</hi> ſince the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe of <hi>Pope Clement</hi> 8. they had made a Decree, forbidding <hi>Secular</hi> men to alienate their goods
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17285:19"/> to <hi>Eccleſiaſtiques;</hi> ſaying, that howſoeuer that law were founded vpon another more ancient, yet this latter was much more ample; that both the one and the other were void, and could not ſubſiſt, as being againſt the <hi>Canons,</hi> againſt the
<hi>Councell,</hi> and againſt the Lawes <hi>Imperiall;</hi> that it was ſcandalous, and made the condition of <hi>Eccleſiaſtiques</hi> worſe then of infamous perſons; adioyning withall, that they which made that law had incurred the <hi>Cenſures.</hi> The he ſame co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his
<hi>Nuntio</hi> to propoſe in full <hi>Senate.</hi> And the
<hi>Embaſſadors</hi> of the <hi>Republique</hi> being come to <hi>Rome</hi> to congratulate with his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> about the beginning of
<hi>Nouember,</hi>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1605</label> hee repeated vnto them the ſame complaints, chargint them at their returne to giue notice thereof vnto the <hi>Senate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the meane while, they of <hi>Genoa,</hi> for to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the
<hi>Pope,</hi> had reuoked the Degree touching the reuiew of the accounts of their Fraternities; but excuſed themſelues for the other Decree touching the Congregation, which for ſecurity of the <hi>State</hi> was neceſſarily to be executed. Which did ſo much enrage the <hi>Pope,</hi> that hee cauſed a <hi>Monitorie</hi> to be imprinted againſt that
<hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> meanacing the <hi>Cardinals</hi> of <hi>Genoa,</hi> that if the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17285:19"/> Decree concerning the <hi>Oratories</hi> were not reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, he would forthwith publiſh his Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> beleeued that by this example the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> would bee induced toyeeld (without vſing any reply) to his deſires; ſtrongly conceiuing that they would willingly abandon their liberty to auoid their trouble, eſpecially, if they were taken before they had time to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate. And therefore without expecting an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to that which the Extraordinary <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> had treated at their returne, or that which the Ordinary had writ to <hi>Venice,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> a new expoſtulated with the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> both touching the impriſoned
<hi>Canon,</hi> and the Ordinance for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned; the matter he exaggerated, ſaying, that the Law had beene made vpon <hi>Maundie Thurſday,</hi> and concluded his ſpeech, (ſhewing the <hi>Monitory</hi> prepared againſt them of <hi>Genoa,)</hi> that he would be obeyed, and that hee would ſend to <hi>Venice</hi> a <hi>Breue</hi> Exhortatory, and after proceed yet further. The <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to his
<hi>Holineſſe,</hi> that the 26. of <hi>March</hi> (on which day the Law was made) could not fall within the <hi>Holy weeke</hi> of that yeare; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that <hi>Eaſter day</hi> was then the tenth of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17285:20"/> 
               <hi>April;</hi> and praied him that, ſince he had required him to write of theſe particularities to <hi>Venice,</hi> and had giuen charge vnto the <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary to treat thereof by word of mouth, he would expect an anſwer before hee determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned any thing in this buſineſſe. This ſtayed the <hi>Pope</hi> for a little time: till that about the middle of <hi>Nouember,</hi> the
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> hauing receiued anſwer to all that which he had written by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> (although he had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of what the Extraordinary <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> had treated,) he made remonſtrance vnto him, following the commandement which hee had from the <hi>Senate;</hi> that the iuſt title and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion which the
<hi>State</hi> hath to iudge <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> perſons in cauſes criminall, were founded on the naturall power of a Soueraigne
<hi>Prince,</hi> and on cuſtome neuer interrupted by the ſpace of a thouſand yeares, and approued by the <hi>Breues</hi> of <hi>Popes</hi> themſelues, yet extant in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique <hi>Archiues:</hi> ſhewing further, that the Law againſt the alienation of <hi>Lay</hi> goods to the
<hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi> had not beene made only at <hi>Venice,</hi> but was alſo receiued and eſtabliſhed in the greater part of the cities of their
<hi>Eſtate;</hi> and for the reſt which had it not, it was their dutie to follow the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17285:20"/> of the Soueraigne and Capitall Citie. He ſhewed likewiſe the equitie of that Law, and how neceſſary it was in theſe times for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of the ſtrength of their
<hi>State,</hi> by many reaſons and examples of ſundry <hi>Chriſtian</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and euen of ſome Cities within the <hi>State Eccleſiaſticall.</hi> The <hi>Pope</hi> heard this diſcourſe with impatience, turning himſelfe from one ſide to another, and teſtifying by the outward geſtures of his face and body, how grieuouſly he did reſent it within; and then he anſwered, that the reaſons alledged were friuolous; that for to iudge of an affaire it was to no purpoſe to ground it vpon cuſtome, which is often ſo much the worſe as it is more ancient. And for the <hi>Breues,</hi> he ſaid there was no other <hi>Archiue</hi> of the
<hi>Breues</hi> of <hi>Popes,</hi> but that at <hi>Rome,</hi> that thoſe which they pretended in fauour of their cauſe were but waſte papers, and that he would lay any wager they had not any authentique <hi>Breues</hi> in this matter. For the Law, he ſaid, that hauing paſſed his youth in the Schooles, and after that practiſed in the Offices of <hi>Vice-Legat,</hi> of
<hi>Auditor</hi> of the <hi>Chamber,</hi> and of Grand <hi>Viccar</hi> of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> he was become well verſed and of good vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in theſe buſineſſes: ſo that he knew
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17285:21"/> certainly that this Law was of itſelfe inualid, as was likewiſe the other of the yeare MD XXX VI: that the power ouer his owne goods belongs to each man, ſo that he may freely diſpoſe of them, neither can that freedome be reſtrained without tyrannie: that the
<hi>Senate</hi> it ſelfe eſteemed it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, forbidding to giue a copie thereof to any perſon; that if elſe-where were any ſuch like Lawes, they had beene made by authoritie of <hi>Popes;</hi> that it pertained not vnto the
<hi>Venetians</hi> to gouerne the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall State,</hi> but to the <hi>Pope,</hi> who might appoint and ordaine what himſelfe pleaſed in that <hi>State;</hi> and that hee would be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed. In all this, the
<hi>Pope</hi> obſerued not (ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelfe to be tranſported by his vehement paſſion) that whilſt he deſired to defend the
<hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall</hi> liberty he gaue vnto <hi>Secular</hi> men too great a licence to diſpoſe of their goods at their pleaſure, without any reſtraint or reſpect of Lawes; &amp; by calling that a tyrannie, which was indeed a iuſt limitation, he principally branded the <hi>Popes</hi> themſelues, guilty of the ſame exceſſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> not content with theſe difficulties, added yet another; vnderſtanding that the <hi>Count Brandolino Valdemarino, Abbot</hi> of <hi>Nerueſe,</hi> was impriſoned, hee commanded that both this
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17285:21"/> 
               <hi>Abbot</hi> and the <hi>Canon</hi> ſhould bee deliuered into the hands of his <hi>Nuntio.</hi> Beſides, he heard of another Ordinance made in the yeare MDC III. whereby was prohibited the building of any new <hi>Church</hi> without the permiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the
<hi>Senate;</hi> which he blamed with rude and violent termes. At laſt, he concluded with theſe words; Euen the Heretique <hi>Moulin</hi> ſaith that
<hi>ſapit haereſim.</hi> Hee adioyned further, that the <hi>State</hi> retained 500000. crownes of <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> Legacies; and charged that in all theſe particulars they ſhould giue him ſatisfaction. The
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> anſwered that <hi>God</hi> had not giuen to
<hi>Popes</hi> any greater au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Gouernment of their
<hi>Eſtate,</hi> then to other <hi>Princes,</hi> who by the Law of Nature haue all power which is neceſſary. And as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth not to the
<hi>Venetians</hi> to Gouerne the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> no more doth it appertaine to <hi>Eccleſiaſtiques</hi> to Gouerne the
<hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice.</hi> That the Law had not beene kept ſo ſecret, ſince it was publiſhed in all their Cities, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regiſtred in the <hi>Chanceries,</hi> where any one might haue a Copie. Moreouer, he ſhewed clearly how falſe a ſuggeſtion it was that the <hi>State</hi> reſerued any portion of Legacies <hi>Eccleſiaſticall;</hi> adding further, that if his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> would examine all
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17285:22"/> the Lawes of their <hi>Signiory,</hi> and giue credit to ſuch calumnies as might be caſt vpon them by their ill willers, the differences would grow infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. Here the <hi>Pope</hi> ſtayed him, and ſaid that for the 500000. crownes his anſwer had ſatisfied him, and that he would not multiply differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but reſtraine them to three heads, that is, to wit, to the Ordinance touching the building of <hi>Churches;</hi> to the Law againſt the alienning of <hi>Lay</hi> mens goods vnto
<hi>Eccleſiaſtiques;</hi> and to the iudgement of the cauſes of the
<hi>Canon</hi> and the <hi>Abbot.</hi> In all theſe three he would be obeyed, adding that they ſhould not thinke to draw out the buſineſſe with delayes, for if ſpeedily they did not ſatisfie him, he would vſe ſuch remedies as he thought conuenient. That he had beene placed in that Chaire for to ſuſtaine the Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction <hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> in defence whereof hee would eſteem himſelfe happy to ſpill his bloud; that for his kindred he regarded not if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſtill priuate perſons, being reſolued to neglect all other reſpects, and to proceed in this matter to the vttermoſt, whatſoeuer ſhould be the iſſue. Withall againe he threatned to ſend a <hi>Breue</hi> exhortatory vnto the <hi>State,</hi> hauing a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne to paſſe on further if he were not obeyed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:17285:22"/> This <hi>Abbot</hi> of <hi>Neralſe</hi> was accuſed to exerciſe a moſt vniuſt and cruel tyranny vpon the
<hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey</hi> neare about his dwelling; taking vp the goods of any man at what price himſelfe was pleaſed; and to commit vile rapes and impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with all ſorts of women, and withall to practiſe in Sorcery and other
<hi>Magicall</hi> opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. That he ſtudied the Art of tempering and compoſing of ſubtill poyſons, whereby he had wrought the death of his brother, of a <hi>Prio rie</hi> of Saint <hi>Auguſtines Order,</hi> and of his ſeruant: theſe two latter becauſe they were conſcious of his crimes, and the firſt becauſe he was his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor in the
<hi>Houſe.</hi> And that with the ſame poiſon he had brought his owne father in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame danger of his life; that he had for a long time the carnall knowledge of his owne ſiſter, and had empoiſoned her maide, fearing by her to be diſcouered; that he had cauſed an enemie of his to be killed, and after that empoiſoned the murtherer, leſt he might accuſe him. Shortly, that he was guiltie of many more murthers and notorious vile crimes.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> they of <hi>Genoa,</hi> by mediation of the <hi>Cardinals</hi> of that Nation (herein more moued with their particular inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17285:23"/> then with any reſpect which they owed to their Countrey) reuoked the Decree which they had made touching the <hi>Oratory,</hi> vpon the <hi>Popes</hi> promiſe that for the time to come they ſhould not therein treat of any thing but matters ſpirituall. Of this reuocation, his
<hi>Holineſſe</hi> quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gaue aduice to the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of
<hi>Venice,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting the <hi>Senate</hi> to deliuer vp the priſonners into the hands of his <hi>Nuntio,</hi> and to reuoke the two Ordinances. And propoſing the example of the <hi>Genuois,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Sequimini paenitentes.</hi> To this the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> anſwered, that there was not the ſame reaſon of the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> ſeeing they had not ſeuen <hi>Cardinals</hi> their <hi>Citizens</hi> to mediate betweene them and his <hi>Holineſſe;</hi> that the things were very different, conſidering that the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the <hi>State</hi> were very neceſſary for the good Gouernment of it; that they were well knowne to his Predeceſſors, who (before their election to the <hi>Papacie)</hi> had liued at <hi>Venice</hi> in qualitie either of <hi>Confeſſors,</hi> or of
<hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> or of <hi>Nuntio's:</hi> and that after their promotion they did not queſtion or diſproue them. To theſe reaſons the
<hi>Pope</hi> replied, that if the lawes of alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and of erecting
<hi>Churches,</hi> were neceſſary, himſelfe would make them, hauing power to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17285:23"/> doe that which is not lawfull for <hi>Secular Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> that if they would haue recourſe to him, they might finde him very ready to impart all kind of fauours, being willing euen to eſtabliſh theſe Lawes, when it ſhould appeare vnto him that they are neceſſary: But that he would not endure them to iudge <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> perſons, who are not ſubiect vnto <hi>Princes,</hi> and whom they cannot chaſtiſe, though they be rebellious; that the former <hi>Popes</hi> did not well vnderſtand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; that he deſired to haue regard to the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his ſoule, and would handle theſe holy bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes according as was meet, and as his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation required; that till then he had done the office of a Father, but now he would come to further remedies. Therefore hee purpoſed to ſend a <hi>Breue</hi> exhortatory concerning the three points aforeſaid, and if he were not obeied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a time, which he would prefix, he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed further; becauſe he had power ouer all, and could depriue <hi>Kings,</hi> and to this end had legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Angels</hi> for his aid and aſſiſtants. The <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador</hi> requeſted the
<hi>Pope</hi> to conſider that it was not meet to proceed in this matter with ſo much precipitation, ſeeing it ſeemed not to the purpoſe to confound the law touching <hi>Churches,</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:17285:24"/> with that of alienation, much leſſe yet the cauſe of the <hi>Canon,</hi> with that of the <hi>Abbot;</hi> eſpecially for that he knew not yet the intention of the <hi>State</hi> in theſe two points, as hauing yet receiued no anſwer; and exhorted his
<hi>Holineſſe</hi> to weigh well the buſineſſe. The <hi>Pope</hi> made anſwer, that himſelfe ought therefore to reply, that he might more ſpeedily know their reſolution.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Senate,</hi> when they had throughly weighed the affaire, and balanced on the one ſide the diſdaine and the raſh proceedings of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> on the other ſide the publike libertie and the neceſſitie of their Gouernment; the firſt of <hi>December</hi> returned anſwer vnto the <hi>Nuntio,</hi> and writ to <hi>Rome</hi> to their
<hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> that they could not render the Priſoners ſo lawfully detained, nor reuoke the Lawes ſo iuſtly ordained, leſt they ſhould preiudice their natural liberty giuen by God vnto the <hi>State,</hi> and preſerued (by the helpe of his diuine <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> and with the bloud of their Anceſtors) for ſo many hundred yeares; and to the end that their Gouernment might not be diſturbed, which had proſpered vnder ſuch Lawes and Cuſtomes vntill this age, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny confuſion brought into their
<hi>State,</hi> which might moue withall ſome perillous ſedition.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17285:24"/> The <hi>Senate</hi> all with one voice conſented vpon this reſolution, whereof the <hi>Nuntio</hi> was aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Which was alſo reported at <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſhew how well the <hi>State</hi> was vnited for defence of their libertie, and to diſcharge the <hi>Pope</hi> of his vaine hope that the <hi>Senators</hi> would be diuided, as the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> had promiſed him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> hauing receiued this anſwer by the Letters of his <hi>Nuntio,</hi> and by the mouth of the <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> did not for all this change his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, but remaining conſtant and reſolued what to doe, to wit, to expedite a <hi>Breue,</hi> hee was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing moued with any thing which the <hi>Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador</hi> could ſay of the reaſons and cauſes which had induced the <hi>Senate</hi> to make this deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of their courage and conſtancie to perſeuere therein, together with the pernicious inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences which might enſue, if his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> ſhould vſe any meanes of violence; but he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that two
<hi>Breues</hi> ſhould be diſpatched, the one concerning the two Lawes, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the two Priſoners.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time there came aduiſe to <hi>Rome</hi> of an
<hi>Edict</hi> made by the <hi>Repub.</hi> of <hi>Luca,</hi> which, to preuent great troubles occaſioned in that <hi>State</hi> by letters of execution ſent from the <hi>Auditor</hi> of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17285:25"/> the <hi>Apoſtolique Chamber,</hi> ordained that thence forward no ſuch letters ſhould haue force, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe firſt they were viewed by the <hi>Magiſtrates.</hi> Whereat the <hi>Pope</hi> chafed beyond meaſure, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it was againſt the libertie
<hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> and his pleaſure was, that this <hi>Edict</hi> ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked, although the <hi>Agent</hi> of that <hi>Signiory</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; that their <hi>State</hi> had herein followed the example of many
<hi>Princes,</hi> and would further follow it in their reuocation, when others ſhould be brought vnto it.</p>
            <p>But for the <hi>Venetian</hi> buſineſſe, it fell out that on the ninth of <hi>December</hi> (an ordinary day of audience for the
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of the <hi>State)</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> treated very courteouſly with him; in ſuch manner as he neuer had ſo fauourable entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Which made him thinke that his vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence being now ſetled, he meant to proceed with maturity; but it happened quite contrary. For the
<hi>Pope</hi> reſoluing to come to action, did not any more vſe violent words, as by the euent appeared. The day following (10. of <hi>December)</hi> he prepared &amp; ſealed two <hi>Breues,</hi> addreſſed <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino Grinani Duci, &amp; Reipub. Venetorum,</hi> which he ſent the ſame day to his <hi>Nuntio,</hi> with charge that he ſhould preſent them. And fearing leſt if
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17285:25"/> this newes of the <hi>Breues</hi> ſent to
<hi>Venice</hi> were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, his <hi>Meſſenger</hi> might be ſtayed or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, he diſpatched another by the way of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi> with <hi>Copies</hi> of the two <hi>Breues</hi> vnto the ſame
<hi>Nuntio;</hi> but neither the one, nor the other <hi>Currier</hi> found any lett, for the <hi>Nuntio</hi> had the Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in good time. After the ſending of theſe <hi>Breues</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> called a
<hi>Conſiſtory</hi> the twelfth of the ſaid <hi>Moneth,</hi> wherein he declared how the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> had violated the
<hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> Libertie, by publiſhing two Lawes, and detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in hold two perſons of the <hi>Church,</hi> dilating a little vpon each one of the three heads: yet he did not take the opinions of the
<hi>Cardinals,</hi> nor ſo much as permitted them to ſpeake; at which the
<hi>Cardinals</hi> murmured, eſteeming it fit not only that ſuch matters ſhould be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to them, but alſo that they ſhould thereof deliberate &amp; giue their iudgements. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oeuer were the ſubſtance of the affaire, they then with one accord agreed that the reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was raſh and perillous. But afterwards when they had conſidered the reaſons of the <hi>Pope</hi> and of the <hi>State,</hi> they differed in iudgement vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter, and diuerſly anſwered the <hi>Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador</hi> of the
<hi>Signiory,</hi> who talked thereof with
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17285:26"/> diuers of them. Some ſaid that the
<hi>Pope</hi> ought rather to haue an eye vpon other more vrgent neceſſities of the <hi>Church,</hi> and to omit theſe que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.
<hi>Cardinall Bellarmine</hi> ſaid clearely that the <hi>Pope</hi> did not ſpeake with him of theſe matters of Iuriſdiction, becauſe they knew his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment herein to be ſparing, and that hee exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his
<hi>Holineſſe</hi> rather to thinke on the Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Prelates in their <hi>Churches. Cardinall Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> ſaid, they were not wont to treat with him of theſe matters, becauſe they knew what was his accuſtomed anſwer. <hi>Cardinall Zapata,</hi> that there were in
<hi>Spaine</hi> Lawes ſemblable to theſe in queſtion: and <hi>Cardinall Monopoly</hi> that the Lawes might be allowed without any material alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, prouided that the <hi>Eccleſiaſtiques</hi> ſhould not be therein mentioned. There were ſome that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued the Lawes, but not the Iudgements; and ſome againe that approued the Iudgements, but not the Lawes. It is certaine that before the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition of the <hi>Breues,</hi> out of a feare of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience, the <hi>Cardinals Baronius,</hi> and <hi>Du Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> did ſecretly in a priuate Audience effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly labour with the
<hi>Pope,</hi> that he would deſiſt from an enterpriſe ſo difficult and perillous; or at leaſt by putting it in deliberation, he would
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17285:26"/> ſerue himſelfe of time for to compaſſe his end, and not put all in danger through precipitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But nothing could make his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt from purſuing the execution of that which he had enterpriſed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Senate</hi> in the meane while, to giue the <hi>Pope</hi> a manifeſt teſtimony of their reſpect, leſt they ſhould ſeeme in any ſort to contemne him, and withall to gaine ſome time, that the
<hi>Pope</hi> might haue leaſure to thinke ſeriouſly of what hee purpoſed to doe; but eſpecially to furniſh themſelues with a iuſt and euident pretext, if they found him obſtinate, thought good to ſend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him an <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> expreſly for this effect: and to the end that by the qualitie of the perſon the <hi>Pope</hi> might ſee what reuerence they carried to the holy <hi>See,</hi> they made choice of the <hi>Lord Leonardo Donato,</hi> an ancient <hi>Senator,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compariſon the moſt eminent in the <hi>State,</hi> who was afterward elected
<hi>Duke.</hi> Beſides, they reſolued to write vnto their
<hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> in all <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> to informe them concerning their publike reaſons, the ſtiffeneſſe of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> and all that was paſſed. But the <hi>Nuntio</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the <hi>Breues</hi> a day after that <hi>Donato</hi> was e lected to goe in <hi>Embaſſage,</hi> ſtayed the preſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17285:27"/> and gaue aduiſe by a Poſte of that Election, which highly moued the <hi>Pope</hi> againſt his <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> for that he had not executed his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and preſumed to interpoſe his owne iudgement after his Ordinance. And therefore he diſpatched vnto him an expreſſe <hi>Currier</hi> with order to preſent the <hi>Breues</hi> immediatly after the receit of his Letter; and that this might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from the Ordinary <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> he cauſed the <hi>Currier</hi> to goe out in a Caroach without boots, and ſo to take horſe at the ſecond ſtage. The <hi>Nuntio</hi> hauing receiued this command on <hi>Chriſtmas Eue,</hi> that he might punctually obey his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> on that ſolemne Feſtiuall day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the <hi>Breues</hi> vnto the
<hi>Counſellors</hi> aſſembled to aſſiſt at a ſolemne
<hi>Maſſe,</hi> in the abſence of the <hi>Duke Grimani,</hi> who was then in his laſt extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and died the day following; which was the cauſe that the <hi>Breues</hi> were not opened, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order of the
<hi>State,</hi> they attended the creation of a new <hi>Duke.</hi> The
<hi>Pope</hi> hauing aduiſe of this from the <hi>Nuntio,</hi> how he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the <hi>Breues,</hi> and how the <hi>Duke</hi> was decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; writ vnto him that he ſhould Proteſt vnto the <hi>State,</hi> and enioyne them not to paſſe on to a new Election, in as much as it ſhould be void,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17285:27"/> being made by men excommunicated, aiming by this new deuice to bring ſome confuſion or diuiſion within the <hi>State,</hi> as ſometime it fals out at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Vacancie of the
<hi>Chaire;</hi> ſhewing himſelfe herein vtterly ignorant of that
<hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> which doth not receiue any alteration by the change of their <hi>Dukes,</hi> or by a Vacancie, but remaineth ſtill equally firme and ſtable. The <hi>Nuntio,</hi> to execute this command, required au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the <hi>State</hi> with great importunitie, but he could not be admitted, it being their cuſtome not to heare any Miniſters of <hi>Princes,</hi> during the Vacancie, vnleſſe their buſineſſe be that of condoling.</p>
            <p>Whilſt they applied themſelues to the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a new

They made remonſtrance vnto him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this enterpriſe, how important it was; to attempt a thing vnheard of in the world, and at once to confound matters Spirituall with the Temporall.

            <p>But the <hi>Electors</hi> did not long delay to acquit hemſelues of their charge: for the tenth of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> M DC VI. by ſcrutiny (according to the cuſtome) they elected vnto the <hi>Dukedome Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardo Donato,</hi> a <hi>Senator</hi> of all the reſt, without controuerſie, the moſt eminent, for his life (full of integritie,) for his experience in Gouerning, and for his exquiſite knowledge in all good Learning; adorned beſides with all heroicall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, qualities rare in this age. All

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17285:29"/> to write vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> as the cuſtome is, and to giue him aduiſe of this Election.</p>
            <p>Vpon this newes there went a rumor in <hi>Rome</hi> that the
<hi>Pope</hi> had a purpoſe not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the new <hi>Duke;</hi> and although it came to the eares of the <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> yet he neglected not to viſit all thoſe who were neare the <hi>Pope,</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the certaine miſchiefes that would enſue if this deliberation were executed; &amp; that for his part he was reſolued what to doe, if his

<hi>Pope</hi> vrged to haue their reſolution, ſaying that they ought not to deferre for default of a <hi>Prince,</hi> and that the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> might well notwithſtanding be aſſembled;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17285:30"/> that they ſhould not thinke to ſpend or gaine time by deliberations, that he was an enemie of time, that he had written in hope of the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the <hi>Republique,</hi> but if he had not a ſpeedy anſwer, hee would reſolue vpon ſome other courſe: and one time he ſaid, We will diſpatch the next morning; which afterward hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained not to haue beene ſpoken affirmatiuely, but only that he might not oblige himſelfe to any limitted time, but remaine free to doe what pleaſed him; &amp; though he ſhould loſe his skin, he would maintaine the cauſe of

<hi>State</hi> in former yeeres had treated, and ordained in their
<hi>Councell</hi> many things contrary to <hi>Eccleſiasticall</hi> liberty, and to the Canons, Councels, and conſtitutions Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall: but among others, that in the yeere M DC III. in the Councell of <hi>Ien,</hi> hauing regard to certaine lawes of their Anceſtors (for bidding to erect Churches or other places of deuotion without permiſſion,) in ſtead of abrogating and diſanulling the old ordinances touching this matter, they had againe reuiued and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed the ſame, and extended that ſtatute, which formerly onely concerned the Citie of <hi>Venice,</hi> to all other places of their Dominion, vnder great penalties; as if Churches and perſons <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiasticall</hi> were in any ſort ſubiect to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall iuriſdiction, or hee, who foundeth a Church, were worthy of ſo rude a chaſtiſement, as if he had committed ſome great crime. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that in the Moneth of May laſt paſt, the <hi>Senate</hi> hauing regard to another law made in the yeere M D XXXVI. whereby was prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the perpetuall alienation of Lay mens goods
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17285:31"/> within the Citie and Dukedome of <hi>Venice</hi> to <hi>Eccleſiasticall</hi> places, without permiſſion of the
<hi>Senate,</hi> vnder certaine penalties, in ſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoking that law (as their dutie required) they had againe renewed the ſame, and extended that law with the penalties to all places of their Dominion, as if it were lawfull for Temporall Princes to ordaine any thing, to exerciſe any iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, or to diſpoſe in any ſort (without the <hi>Eccleſiastiques,</hi> and particularly without leaue from the <hi>Pope)</hi> of the goods of the Church, eſpecially of ſuch goods as haue beene giuen vnto <hi>Churches,</hi> perſons <hi>Eccleſiasticall,</hi> and other places of deuotion, by the faithfull, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie of their ſins and diſcharge of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. That theſe ordinances, tending to the damnation of ſoules, to publique ſcandall, and alſo contrary to the <hi>Eccleſiasticall</hi> liberty, were of themſelues void and of no value, as further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more he declared them to be ſuch, no man being obliged to obſerue them: On the contrary, that they, which had made theſe <hi>Statutes</hi> (or any like) or which had furthered them, had incurred <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall</hi> Cenſures, and depriued themſelues of all ſuch lands as they held of the <hi>Church,</hi> as alſo their <hi>Eſtates,</hi> and Demaines were ſubiect to other
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:17285:31"/> penalties, in ſuch ſort that they could not be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, vnleſſe they reuoked all ſuch lawes, and reeſtabliſhed all things in their former eſtate. That hereupon being placed in the Soueraigne Throne, and not being able to diſſemble or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure theſe things, he admoniſhed the <hi>Republique</hi> to conſider the danger whereinto they had caſt their ſoules vpon this occaſion, and betimes to ſeeke a remedy; otherwiſe in caſe of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he commanded vnder the paine of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication <hi>latae ſententiae,</hi> that the foreſaid Laws, both ancient and moderne, ſhould be reuoked and diſanulled: that this <hi>Monitory</hi> ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiſhed in all places of their <hi>State,</hi> and that he expected from them account there of; if they did it not, that he ſhould be conſtrained (after his <hi>Nuntio</hi> had giuen him notice that his Letters were preſented) to come to execution of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, and to ſuch other remedies as he ſhould thinke meet: remembring the reckoning which he was to giue vnto <hi>God</hi> at the day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and declaring that he (who had no other end but the repoſe, and tranquillitie of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth)</hi> could not in duty diſſemble, when the authority of the <hi>See Apoſtolique</hi> was dimini ſhed,
<hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> liberty trod vnder foot, the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17285:32"/> holy <hi>Canons</hi> and Decrees neglected, the rights of <hi>Churches</hi> and the priuiledges of <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> perſons violated, of all which the charge and cuſtodie is committed to him: beſides, affirming that hee was not moued to doe this by any worldly conſideration, nor deſired any other thing but the glory to exerciſe perfectly (ſo farre as he could) his <hi>Apoſtolique</hi> Gouernment. And as he did not purpoſe to vſurpe any thing vpon the <hi>Secular</hi> Authority, ſo would he not permit that the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> ſhould be diminiſhed. That if the <hi>State</hi> would obey his commandements, they ſhould deliuer him from great paine which he ſuffered in their regard, and might ſtill retaine the lands which they held of the
<hi>Church.</hi> That by no other means the <hi>Republique</hi> could ſo well ſecure it ſelfe from the incommodities which it ſuffered by
<hi>Infidels,</hi> as by conſeruing the rights and liberties of

            <p>The <hi>Senate</hi> conſidering theſe difficulties rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> deliberated to conferre thereof with their

               <hi>Lawyers</hi> at that time, as it appeareth by the workes which they haue publiſhed. And further, that they might haue neere them a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor</hi> verſed in <hi>Diuinity,</hi> and in the
<hi>Canon</hi> Law, they called vnto the ſeruice of the <hi>Signiory Frier Paul</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> of the Order of the <hi>Seruites</hi> With theſe three, and with other principall <hi>Doctors</hi> of the
<hi>Vniuerſitie</hi> of <hi>Padua,</hi> as alſo with thoſe of the Citie of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the neighbouring places, men eminent for ſound learning and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, the <hi>Senate</hi> aduiſed how to anſwer the <hi>Pope</hi> with moſt conueniency. They reſolued al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to conſult on theſe queſtions the moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious <hi>Doctors</hi> of
<hi>Italy,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and to vſe their counſel touching other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties which might be offered. And in ſhort time they had the iudgement of many excellent <hi>Lawyers</hi> of
<hi>Italy</hi> not ſubiect to the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> and in particular of <hi>Iames Menochio Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> a perſon illuſtrious for his honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Labours in the defence and maintenance of the Authority of <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and for his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Writings which hee hath publiſhed, and wherein he ſhall liue for euer. They had alſo not long after ſent vnto them in writing the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the moſt renowned <hi>Doctors</hi> of <hi>France</hi> &amp;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17285:33"/> 
               <hi>Spaine,</hi> who by diuers arguments ſhewed eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently that the controuerſies moued by the <hi>Pope,</hi> concerned neerely the <hi>Temporall</hi> Power, wherein the <hi>Papall</hi> authoritie ought not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle; and therefore that it was lawfull for the
<hi>Republique</hi> to make any ſuch Ordinances, ſo farre as reſpects of Gouernment might require. There were alſo ſent to <hi>Venice</hi> the Lawes of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the <hi>Realmes</hi> and <hi>Eſtates</hi> of
<hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> wherein the like Ordinances are obſerued; which afterwards were alledged in diuers Bookes pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in fauour of the right of the <hi>Republique.</hi> But for that time the <hi>Senate</hi> vnderſtanding the iudgement of the <hi>Doctors,</hi> made anſwer the 28. of
<hi>Ianuary,</hi> in theſe words for ſubſtance; That with much griefe and wonder they vnderſtood by the Letters of his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> that the
<hi>Lawes</hi> of their <hi>State</hi> obſerued carefully through ſo many ages, and neuer queſtioned by any of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, (the reuoking whereof would ſubuert the Foundations of their <hi>Common-wealth)</hi> were reprehended as contrary to the authority of the <hi>See Apoſtolique;</hi> and that they which made them (Perſons of great pietie, meriting well of the
<hi>See Apoſtolique,</hi> who are now in Heauen) were noted for violators of
<hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17285:33"/> That according to the admonition of his
<hi>Holineſſe,</hi> they had examined, and cauſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine their Lawes old and new, but had found nothing which might not well be ordained by the authoritie of a Soueraigne <hi>Prince,</hi> or which might iuſtly offend the
<hi>Popes</hi> authority; being euidently a thing belonging to the care of a Secular <hi>Prince,</hi> to haue regard what Companies are erected within his Dominions, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent the building of ſuch Edifices as in time to come may be hurtfull to the publique ſafetie. And although their <hi>State</hi> abound with <hi>Churches</hi> and places of Deuotion, as much as any other, yet (when they ſee conuenient) they haue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer refuſed to giue permiſſion to new Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, themſelues thereunto contributing liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. That in the Law againſt the perpetuall alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Lay</hi> goods vnto
<hi>Eccleſiastiques,</hi> the queſtion being of things purely
<hi>Temporall,</hi> they could not be taxed to haue done any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Decrees.</hi> That if the <hi>Popes</hi> haue power to forbid the <hi>Clergie</hi> to alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate any goods of the <hi>Church</hi> vnto Perſons <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> without leaue; <hi>Princes</hi> may doe the ſame, and take order that the goods of <hi>Seculars</hi> ſhall not be alienated to the <hi>Clergie</hi> without permiſſion.

            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:17285:34"/> In the meane while the <hi>Pope</hi> longed with an extreame deſire to haue their anſwer to his <hi>Breues,</hi> which he expected would be conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his fantaſie; and he could not be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the <hi>State</hi> would haue more care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue their Liberty, than feare of his threatnings. Which that he might make to appeare more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable, he ſerued himſelfe not only of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of them of
<hi>Genoa,</hi> but yet of one much greater. For hauing notice that the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoy</hi> had commanded the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of
<hi>Foſſano</hi> to depart out of his Dominions (which he was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned to doe vpon great and important reaſons,) being hereby incenſed, he menaced the <hi>Duke</hi> with Excommunication, vnleſſe he reuoked his commandement.</p>
            <p>At length the Letters of the <hi>Senate</hi> arriued at
<hi>Rome,</hi> and were preſented by the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the
<hi>Pope,</hi> who opened them in his preſence, and at the firſt ſight was greatly moued for the errour committed in the preſentation of two
<hi>Breues</hi> both of one tenor, in ſtead of two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; and attributed the fault herein vnto his <hi>Nuntio.</hi> And paſſing further in the reading of the Letter, he ſhewed himſelfe much more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. In the end, not comming to particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17285:35"/> he ſaid; that the Monitory <hi>Breues</hi> could not be anſwered, and that the anſwers of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> were friuolous: that the matter was cleare, and that he was peremptorily reſolued to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on further. He added, that lately he had heard of another Law, touching goods <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall</hi> holden as <hi>Emphyteuticke,</hi> which his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was ſhould be reuoked with the other; and although till then he had not mentioned this Law (becauſe he knew not of it,) yet hee had more to ſay againſt it, than againſt all the other; that it behoued in all theſe things to obey him, becauſe his cauſe was the cauſe of
<hi>God, Et portae inferinon praeualebunt aduerſus eam.</hi> That if the
<hi>Monks</hi> of <hi>Padua</hi> or other places ſhould purchaſe more than were meet, they might haue recourſe to him, and that in this caſe he would prouide, the <hi>Secular</hi> Authority being not herein to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medle, which the <hi>Venetians</hi> doing, were <hi>Tyrants</hi> and different fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Anceſtors. The <hi>Pope</hi> ſpake all this with ſo great heat, that the
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> did not iudge fit at that time to paſſe on further: wherefore after ſome words concerning the laſt Law, he tooke leaue. But as he was going out of the Chamber of Audience, the <hi>Pope</hi> called him backe, and riſing from his ſeat, hee tooke
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17285:35"/> him into a chamber apart: where, releaſing ſome what the extŕeme rigor which hitherto he had vſed, he diſcourſed moderately of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions, and heard the anſwers of the
<hi>Ambaſs.</hi> as ſhe wing himſelfe inclined to ſome compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and touching the Law newly queſtioned he concluded that he had not ſpoken of it if they had giuen him any ſatisfaction in the other two compriſed in the <hi>Breue</hi> which he had ſent. And for the Priſoners, that if they rendred the <hi>Canon</hi> vnto his <hi>Nuntio,</hi> he would in fauour yeeld and deliuer the <hi>Abbot</hi> to the iudgement of the Secular Magiſtrate; but that this ſhould be done ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, becauſe he was an enemie of time, and would not that they ſhould defer in hope that the <hi>Pope</hi> might die. That if within fifteene daies he had contentment, he promiſed not to trouble them during his <hi>Pontificate,</hi> but if that time were expired that he would proceed. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he counſelled the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> to write here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and that to this effect he meant to diſpatch a
<hi>Currier,</hi> as alſo he did. And in conformitie of this the
<hi>Nuntio</hi> ſpake in <hi>Senate,</hi> exhorting them with many words to giue ſatisfaction vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> by reuoking the two Lawes and by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering the <hi>Canon;</hi> promiſing that this being
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:17285:36"/> done, from his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> they ſhould receiue as ample fauours as in former times had beene euer granted by the <hi>See Apoſtolique</hi> to any <hi>Prince.</hi> He mentioned alſo the Law of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyteuſes,</hi> which the <hi>Pope</hi> eſteemed more oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to his authoritie than the other two; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he did not much inlarge himſelfe vpon this point, but left it without concluſion, which cauſed in the <hi>Senate</hi> a great aſtoniſhment, and the
<hi>Duke</hi> not vnderſtanding fully his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, deſired of him a more ample and exact explication. But the <hi>Nuntio</hi> approching neere him, ſaid in his eare, that it was not needfull to paſſe further vpon that ſubject, promiſing on his word vnto his <hi>Highneſſe</hi> that there ſhould be no more ſpeech of it. The <hi>Duke</hi> did not thinke fit to keepe ſecret this promiſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he repeated aloud what the
<hi>Nuntio</hi> had ſaid vnto him and on his word had promiſed.</p>
            <p>This releaſe of rigor which the <hi>Pope</hi> vſed at
<hi>Rome</hi> and his <hi>Nuntio</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> made men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that vpon the arriuall of the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> with his
<hi>Holineſſe</hi> all theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates would eaſily be compoſed. The
<hi>Senate</hi> did much deſire that the <hi>Pope</hi> would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by their reaſons, and therefore anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17285:36"/> the <hi>Nuntio</hi> (who earneſtly moued them for their reſolution) that <hi>Duodo</hi> ſhould goe to his
<hi>Holineſſe</hi> to repreſent vnto him that which had paſſed. But the <hi>Pope</hi> ſcarcely let paſſe the fifteene daies, when being returned to his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed rigor (though the <hi>Ambaſſador Nani</hi> had told him that <hi>Duodo</hi> was already diſpatched) in the moneth of
<hi>February,</hi> he complained that they deferred ſo long, ſaying he could not in any ſort endure ſuch delay, and that he would not be tied to expect any longer. And a few daies afterward, when the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> was rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> ſome newes of the route of
<hi>Cicala</hi> vpon the confines of <hi>Perſia,</hi> he made not any reflexion vpon this narration, but think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the while vpon <hi>Duodo,</hi> he ſaid; Let him not come with any more reaſons, for you haue ſpoken thereof ſufficiently. The <hi>Pope</hi> remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned firme in his deliberation, and accordingly commanded his <hi>Nuntio</hi> to preſent the other
<hi>Breue,</hi> dated the 10. of <hi>December</hi> before, and addreſſed to
<hi>Marin Grimani Duke,</hi> and to the <hi>Republique</hi> of the
<hi>Venetians,</hi> concerning the <hi>Canon</hi> and the <hi>Abbot</hi> Priſoners: which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement hee executed the 25. of <hi>February</hi> two daies after the departure of <hi>Duodo</hi> going to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17285:37"/> 
               <hi>Rome,</hi> his inſtructions being expedited vpon the 18. of the ſame <hi>Moneth.</hi> The <hi>Duke</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be much offended, that this <hi>Breue</hi> ſhould be deliuered two daies after the departure of an <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> ſent vpon this buſineſſe, and ſo much more becauſe it was not addreſſed to him, but ſhould haue beene preſented to his Predeceſſor. In this
<hi>Breue</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> ſaid; That he vnderſtood by the letters of his <hi>Nuntio</hi> and by the diſcourſes of their <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> that the <hi>Canon</hi> and <hi>Abbot,</hi> arreſted hereto fore by the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the <hi>State,</hi> were ſtill detained, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that they had power to doe this by vertue of ſome Priuiledges giuen them by the <hi>See Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolique,</hi> and by a cuſtome which they haue to iudge perſons
<hi>Eccleſiaſticall;</hi> which things he would willingly ſuffer if they were conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſacred <hi>Conſtitutions.</hi> But being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the holy <hi>Canons</hi> and to <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty (which hath ground in diuine ordinance, he was forced by the dutie of his office to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe them that their cuſtome was not auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as being repugnant to <hi>Canonicall</hi> inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Therefore there remained one onely ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whether the <hi>State</hi> had any priuiledge gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto them by his <hi>Predeceſſors;</hi> that herein
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17285:37"/> they ſhould ſpeake ingenuouſly and with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, to the end it might be examined by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and the <hi>Rom. Church,</hi> who hereupon might giue their neceſſarie admonitions. That they miſtooke their grant, and conceiued it larger than it was indeed; becauſe that the <hi>Republique</hi> had ouerpaſſed their iuriſdiction, as hauing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it to perſons and caſes and places which were exempted, (whereof his <hi>Predeceſſors</hi> had ſometime made complaint,) and by conſequent had forfeited their Priuiledges, as not obſeruing the conditions preſcribed when they were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For which reaſons he commanded vnder paine of Excommunication <hi>latae ſententiae,</hi> that ſpeedily the
<hi>Canon</hi> and the <hi>Abbot</hi> ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered into the hands of his <hi>Nuntio,</hi> who ſhould chaſtiſe them according to the grauitie of their crimes, leſt any ſhould thinke that his Miniſters would abuſe their <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie and exemptions: and all men knew that he intended that the <hi>Eccleſiaſtiques</hi> ſhould giue example of goodneſſe to all others. That if the Secular Officers had already proceeded to any acts or ſentences of condemnation or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, he did annull them and declare them void, threatning that if he were not obeyed, or
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17285:38"/> if they deferred to obey him, he would proceed further, ſo as Iuſtice ſhould require, not purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to neglect any thing pertaining to his charge, for the conſeruation of the
<hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> iuriſdiction.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Senate</hi> hauing heard the contents of the <hi>Breue,</hi> although they had already conſulted the <hi>Doctors</hi> not onely touching the Lawes mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the <hi>Pope</hi> in his other <hi>Breue,</hi> but alſo touching the queſtion of iudging <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiques,</hi> which his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> firſt of all quarrelled, as hath beene ſaid: and though they were by them reſolued that the cuſtome practiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all memorie in the <hi>State</hi> was lawfull and well grounded; yet neuertheleſſe leſt any thing might be neglected, which might helpe to cleare theſe difficulties, againe they aſſembled the ſame
<hi>Doctors</hi> which reſided in <hi>Venice,</hi> or other parts, and required their opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the contents of this <hi>Breue,</hi> what anſwer were fit to be made. Vpon which conſultation, and after they had duely examined all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the <hi>Senate</hi> anſwered the
<hi>Pope</hi> the 11. of <hi>March</hi> in theſe termes: That the

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17285:38"/> that theſe matters of diſcord did euery day increaſe, and that his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> purpoſed to deſtroy the Lawes of their <hi>Republique,</hi> which till this age ſo long had beene preſerued intire. For to command them to deliuer vp vnto his <hi>Nuntio</hi> the <hi>Canon</hi> and the <hi>Abbot,</hi> was nothing elſe but to demand that they ſhould deſpoyle themſelues of their iuſt power to chaſtiſe crimes and wickedneſſe, which power they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed (euen with the approbation of <hi>Popes)</hi> from the originall of their
<hi>Common-wealth.</hi> That <hi>God</hi> had beſtowed this power vpon them which were the firſt founders and eſtabliſhers of their <hi>State,</hi> and from them deriued to the preſent Gouernours; which they had euer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed with moderation, without exceeding their lawfull bounds. That the precedent <hi>Popes</hi> had herein approued them, and if ſome one among them had attempted ought in preiudice of this authoritie giuen by <hi>God</hi> vnto the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique,</hi> this could not any way depriue them of their right, nor did they forbeare notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to exerciſe their authoritie. That the <hi>Senate</hi> were ſufficiently perſwaded, conſidering the puritie of their conſcience in this cauſe, no place was left for the threatnings of his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe; </hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:17285:39"/> hoping alſo that he would take in good part that which the <hi>Senate</hi> anciently and of late had done in this caſe for the honour of <hi>God,</hi> and in conſideration of the publique repoſe, and for the puniſhment of malefactors.</p>
            <p>Preſently after the <hi>Pope</hi> had diſpatched his
<hi>Commiſsion</hi> vnto his <hi>Nuntio</hi> to preſent the <hi>Breue,</hi> he had aduice that in <hi>Rome</hi> there went a rumor that he was deſiſted (or at leaſt much abated) in his pretenſions. Which ſo extremely vexed him, that for to quench it, and to recouer the reputation which hee ſeemed to haue hereby loſt, he reſolued to ſpeake a new in
<hi>Conſiſtorie,</hi> and make it there appeare, how he perſiſted in the ſame deliberations. Wherefore the 20. of <hi>February,</hi> the
<hi>Cardinals</hi> being aſſembled, hee made remonſtrance what he had ſaid the firſt time, and adioyned what hee had yet to ſay againſt the Law of the <hi>Emphyteuſes.</hi> Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe he did not permit any of the <hi>Cardinals</hi> in theſe points to ſpeake any thing, but paſſed on to <hi>Conſiſtoriall</hi> matters. After at the audience of the
<hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> he complained of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies, and that the
<hi>Extraordinarie</hi> was too ſlow in comming, menacing that he would abridge the buſineſſe. The <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> failed not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17285:39"/> that the <hi>Republique</hi> was not accuſtomed to defer affaires; that it ſeemed his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> meant to precipitate things, foraſmuch as in the <hi>Conſistorie</hi> 12. of <hi>Decemb</hi> he had complained of the <hi>Republique</hi> touching the Law againſt building of <hi>Churches,</hi> before he vnderſtood ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by word or writing what was the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Senate</hi> in that behalfe. And further, that in the laſt <hi>Conſiſtorie</hi> hee had made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint concerning the Law which he called of <hi>Emphyteuſes,</hi> of which neither himſelfe had written any one word, nor had commanded him to write thereof, nor cauſed his <hi>Nuntio</hi> to mention it. The
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> alſo endeuoured by the mediation of <hi>Card. Borgheſe</hi> to ſtop a little the violent courſes of the <hi>Pope.</hi> But the <hi>Cardinall</hi> excuſing the <hi>Pope</hi> anſwered that hee could not now giue backe ſince he had twiſe ingaged himſelfe in this affaire, in the <hi>Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> and to all <hi>Princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After theſe things arriued at <hi>Rome</hi> the anſwer of the
<hi>Senate,</hi> with charge vnto the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> to preſent it immediatly, before the comming of <hi>Duodo,</hi> to the end that if the differences were by him compoſed, yet this <hi>Breue</hi> might not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vnanſwered. The <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> therefore
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:17285:40"/> quickly preſented it; but the <hi>Pope</hi> not willing to reade it in his preſence, as he did the other, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid; that the <hi>Venetians</hi> did iuſt like thoſe that ſtrike firſt, and then complaine; that he would heare the Extraordinary <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> but not treat with him; that if he brought him not ſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, he would paſſe on. He added his vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all complaints, that they meant to delay the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire, and take the benefit of time, of which he was an enemy, not being able to endure any more prolongings. He complained beſides, that the
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> Extraordinary deferred too long his comming, not becauſe he hoped by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to finde or admit any compoſition, being already reſolued, and fully in his minde deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to purſue againſt the <hi>Republique</hi> the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which they had offered vnto the
<hi>Church,</hi> but becauſe hauing ſaid to many Miniſters of
<hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> that he would giue audience to that <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi> he could not well proceed till firſt he had heard him ſpeake: being extreamely vexed to ſee daies paſſing without comming to executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Likewiſe he writ a new to his <hi>Nuntio's</hi> which he had with all
<hi>Princes,</hi> commanding them in his Name to make complaints againſt the
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique,</hi> which being knowne at <hi>Venice;</hi> the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17285:40"/> 
               <hi>Senate</hi> reſolued to write vnto all
<hi>Courts,</hi> and to ſend ample inſtructions to all their
<hi>Ambaſſadors,</hi> to the end that on all occaſions they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the iuſtice of their cauſe, with their vniuſt vexations by the <hi>Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the end of <hi>March, Duodo</hi> the Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> arriued at <hi>Rome,</hi> who was not ſuffered to paſſe the firſt Audience in Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments according to the cuſtome, but the <hi>Pope</hi> without other diſcourſe falling vpon the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe heard him courteouſly, yet would not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to any particular, although the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> propounded to his conſideration the ſeuerall reaſons pertaining to each Controuerſie. But ſtaying only on the generall, he ſaid; that the exemption of the <hi>Eccleſiastiques</hi> was
<hi>de iure diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> and therefore he would not now content himſelfe with (what he formerly had propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) the reſtoring only of the one Priſoner: that he would not meddle with things <hi>Temporall,</hi> but their three Lawes were vſurpations; that he was not moued with any paſſion, and that his cauſe was the cauſe of <hi>God:</hi> that the Ordinary
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> had often repeated vnto him theſe ſame allegations, but all were of no force: and that he would heare him to doe him a pleaſure,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17285:41"/> but not to depart in any thing from his reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that he would be obeyed, and ſuch other like diſcourſes. The <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> to ſtay a little this torrent, and to giue him time to be thinke himſelfe, offered to write to <hi>Venice</hi> what was his reſolution: wherewith the <hi>Pope</hi> was content, counting in what time the <hi>Currier</hi> might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne with an anſwer, and threatning that hee would not waite one moment longer. Which thing being knowne at <hi>Venice,</hi> it was reſolued that all ſhould be communicated vnto the
<hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours</hi> of the <hi>Emperour,</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and of
<hi>Spaine.</hi> The <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of the <hi>Emperour</hi> ſaid that his <hi>Maſter</hi> deſired Peace, and that in ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters he would not foment the will of the <hi>Pope</hi> The <hi>Count</hi> of
<hi>Cante-croix</hi> approued all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which were repreſented to him, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Francke,</hi> a County in his Countrey, where the ſame things are obſerued. <hi>Monſieur de Freſne, Ambaſſador</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> anſwered, that he knew not what to make of theſe
<hi>Pontificall</hi> Lawes, by which <hi>Princes</hi> are forbidden to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne their <hi>Eſtates,</hi> and that in all reaſon the <hi>Repub.</hi> ought to preferre their Libertie to all other reſpects, for <hi>ſalus populi ſuprema lex eſto,</hi> the weale of the people ought to be the Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:17285:41"/> 
               <hi>Duodo,</hi> as the cuſtome is, viſited the <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,</hi> and had ſpeech with all of them touching the differences in queſtion; and although they anſwered differently, yet it appeared they had no great hand in the affaire, ſaue onely that they heard it propounded in the <hi>Conſiſtory</hi> vpon the twelfth of
<hi>December,</hi> and the twentieth of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary. Duodo</hi> did not ceaſe in other Audiences which the <hi>Pope</hi> gaue him, to aſſay if he could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way aſſwage him; hoping that the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might be reduced to ſome termes of accord, if he might finde meanes a little to hinder his
<hi>Holineſſe</hi> from his headlong courſes. But the <hi>Pope</hi> ſtill ſhewing himſelfe reſolute, ſaying that he had vſed a very great patience: that the <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> were ſtill more obſtinate, and his condition euery day worſe; for he vnderſtood how it was openly ſpoken in <hi>Venice,</hi> that they were not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed herein to giue him any ſatisfaction, that therefore he could not abandon his reputation: that in the
<hi>Senate</hi> there was not one that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood theſe matters, and that they were content to conſult thereof with their <hi>Doctors,</hi> but that hee had written to ſuch Perſons as were able to ſet their
<hi>Doctors</hi> to Schoole, and concluded that he would proceed with his Spirituall Armes;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17285:42"/> but in other things he would account of the
<hi>Venetians</hi> as of his children. The <hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> hearing his reſolution, and knowing it would be to little effect for him to reply, retired him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from the Audience with few words, but full of prudence and grauitie.</p>
            <p>The day following, the <hi>Cardinals</hi> of <hi>Verona</hi> and
<hi>Vicenza</hi> found meanes to inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues neere the
<hi>Pope,</hi> and to talke with him vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſubiect: where they did very good and effectuall offices, exhorting his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> to vſe ſome delaies: whereto he anſwered, that he had deferred but too long; that the offer by him propoſed to the <hi>Ambaſſadour Nani,</hi> had beene eſteemed not worthy an anſwer; that he had heard the Extraordinary, although he ſpake big: that he had fiue and twenty or thirty Letters from
<hi>Venice,</hi> whereby hee had notice that hee could not hope for any ſatisfaction. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, that he would yet giue terme of foure and twenty dayes, which was enough time to giue them for their repentance. The <hi>Cardinals</hi> repreſented vnto him with many and powerfull words what damage might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, if the Spirituall armes ſhould be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. To which the <hi>Pope</hi> anſwered, that then he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17285:42"/> would employ the Temporall. And ſo without communicating that which he had in minde to many perſons, he cauſed to draw vp and imprint a <hi>Monitory</hi> againſt the <hi>Republique;</hi> which after reuiewing and finding it not to his liking, hee changed it, and at laſt compoſed and made to be imprinted another, dated the 17. of <hi>Aprill,</hi> purpoſing to publiſh it that day in <hi>Conſiſtory.</hi> But that morning he was found very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in ſpirit, and perplexed what he ſhould do; and the houre approching, (the <hi>Cardinals</hi> being already aſſembled) he began profoundly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider within himſelfe, whether to proceed as he had determined, or to deferre the buſineſſe till ſome other time. But the <hi>Cardinall Arrigon</hi> (who, according to the cuſtom of the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> which haue part in the Gouernment, was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended into the <hi>Hall</hi> with the reſt, but was gone vp into the Chamber of his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> with his <hi>Nephew,</hi> for to accompany him downe,) exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him by no meanes to relent. Whereupon againe reſoluing vpon his former purpoſe, he entred the <hi>Conſiſtory,</hi> where he made recitall of his pretenſions againſt the <hi>Republique,</hi> inlarging his ſpeech particularly vpon that Law (by him called) of Farmes
<hi>Emphyteuticke,</hi> although he
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17285:43"/> ſaid he had written nothing thereof to
<hi>Venice,</hi> nor tretaed of it with the <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> ſaue only that he had told him, he had obſerued it. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned, that he had firſt himſelfe ſtudyed theſe points, then he had conferred thereof with the moſt famous <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> who did conclude that the ordinances of the <hi>Republique</hi> were contrary to the Authority of the <hi>See Apoſtolique,</hi> and to liberty <hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> all edging further that they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned by the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Pope Symma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> &amp; by that of <hi>Lyons</hi> vnder <hi>Pope Gregory</hi>
10. as alſo by the Decrees of the <hi>Councels</hi> or Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of
<hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil;</hi> that this matter had been declared againſt <hi>Henry</hi> 2. <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> againſt the
<hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Kings Charles</hi> the 2. and <hi>Charles</hi> the 4. That he knew well there were ſome
<hi>Doctors Canoniſts,</hi> who approued that Law, forbidding the aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Lay</hi> mens goods in fauour of the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi> but that they were of ſmall number and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and ſpake againſt the common opinion. And in caſe there yet remain'd any doubt, he did then declare that all theſe Lawes were contrary to <hi>Eccleſiasticall</hi> Liberty. Beſides he cauſed to be read a Conſtitution of <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a certaine Edict of <hi>Henry Emperiour</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople;</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:17285:43"/> and proceeding to ſpeake of crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall iudgements againſt perſons <hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> hee ſaid that the <hi>Venetians</hi> pretended to haue ſome priuiledges, which not withſtanding they did extend to places and cauſes not compriſed in them, euen againſt the perſons of <hi>Biſhops.</hi> He commended further his patience, hauing ſo long time expected their repentance: by reaſon whereof he might, without further delay or granting any longer terme, come to the
<hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict;</hi> but <hi>mitius agendo,</hi> hee had deliberated to giue them reſpite of foure and twenty daies more; and that he might doe all things
<hi>cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically,</hi> he was content to take the voices and ſuffrages of the
<hi>Cardinals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon each one gaue his ſuffrage; and firſt the
<hi>Cardinall Pinelli</hi> commended his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> for that he had aſſigned foure and twenty daies for terme of reſpite, becauſe ſo much had beene aſſigned to <hi>Henry 3. King</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> The
<hi>Card. d'Aſcoli</hi> made a ſigne with his head that he was of the ſame opinion, without ſpeaking word which could be vnderſtood, as alſo hee had done vnder <hi>Clement</hi> 8. when the <hi>Monitorie</hi> againſt the <hi>Duke Caeſar d'Eſte</hi> was publiſhed. The <hi>Card.</hi> of
<hi>Verona,</hi> hauing praiſed the zeale of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:17285:44"/> his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> who had proceeded (he ſaid) in this affaire <hi>lentâ feſtinatione;</hi> he added, that in a <hi>Senate</hi> compoſed of ſo great a number of perſons, as was that of <hi>Venice,</hi> things could not be diſpatched with ſuch ſpeedineſſe; that it was not good to bee too haſtie againſt a
<hi>Repub.</hi> which had well-merited; that the buſineſſe might well be yet a while deferred vpon hope thereby to gaine them, and in the meane time men might haue time to weigh their reaſons, and he concluded with theſe words,
<hi>Sed differ, habent paruae commoda magnamorae;</hi> But defer, holy Father, little delaies ſometime bring great commodities. At this word the
<hi>Pope</hi> interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſaid, that he had done nothing of his owne proper iudgement; that he had aduiſed with learned men, and beene directed by their counſell. Whereupon the <hi>Card.</hi> replyed, if this were ſo he could not contradict that which had beene reſolued by his
<hi>Holineſſe.</hi> The <hi>Cardinall Sauli</hi> ſaid, that the
<hi>Venetians</hi> had beene too long forborne and heard; that it was meet to vſe rigor againſt them to make them yeeld; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for his part, he thought it good to proceed with courage in this buſineſſe, referring the iſſue to <hi>God</hi> whoſe cauſe was handled. The
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17285:44"/> 
               <hi>Card.</hi> of <hi>Saint Cecile</hi> ſaid, that he lamented the condition of the times, which forced his
<hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe</hi> to haue recourſe to ſuch remedies, but withall hee reioyced that in this his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> had not any humane reſpect, but aimed onely at the honour of <hi>God,</hi> and the dignity and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the <hi>Church.</hi> The <hi>Card. Bandini</hi> prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>God</hi> who had giuen occaſion vnto his <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe</hi> in the beginning of his
<hi>Papacie</hi> to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe vnto himſelfe an immortall renowne, by reſtoring the <hi>Eccleſiasticall</hi> liberty and iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The ſuffrage of <hi>Card. Baronius,</hi> groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon that <hi>Theme,</hi> that the miniſtery of <hi>S. Peter</hi> hath two parts, the one to feed, the other to kill, hath beene ſo often publiſhed, that it ſeemes not needfull here to mention it. The <hi>Card. Iuſtiniano</hi> ſaid, that he conformed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the iudgement of his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> being iuſtly taken vpon a caſe notorious, <hi>Notorietate facti &amp; notorietate iuris;</hi> that he ſaw not what excuſe the <hi>Venetians</hi> could alledge; that to wait any longer ſhould be to nouriſh them in their ſins, and to partake with them; vpon theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he commended the reſolution of his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> The <hi>Card Zapata</hi> ſaid, that the delay of twenty foure daies was too long, and that the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17285:45"/> 
               <hi>Ecclefiaſtiques</hi> vnder the
<hi>Venetians</hi> were in worſe condition then were the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> vnder <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh.</hi> The <hi>Card. Conti</hi> gaue thanks to <hi>God</hi> who in theſe times had giuen a <hi>Pope</hi> vigorous of age and ſtrength, which by his zeale and vertue could and would reſtore againe <hi>Ecclefiaſticall</hi> liberty and the authority of the <hi>See Apoſtolique.</hi> All the reſt with few words conſented, or after a repetition of the reaſons vrged by the <hi>Pope,</hi> confirmed them, or amplified the reaſons and allegations of the <hi>Canoniſts.</hi> Which being done, they paſſed to <hi>Conſiſtoriall</hi> propoſitions accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their cuſtome. The number of <hi>Cardinals</hi> preſent in this <hi>Conſiſtorie</hi> were forty and one; the <hi>Cardinals</hi> of
<hi>Como, Aldobrandin, Santiquattro</hi> and <hi>Caeſis</hi> not going that morning.</p>
            <p>No other thing could be expected from the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> but that they would conſent to the deliberations of the <hi>Pope;</hi> ſome by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per inclination being carried to the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as being paſſionate for the <hi>Ecclefiaſticall</hi> liberty; others becauſe their particular intereſts (by reaſon of the pretenſions which they might haue vnto the <hi>Papacie)</hi> forced them to accord; others had not the boldneſſe to contradict the <hi>Pope</hi> in any matter, leſt they ſhould ſo cut off
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17285:45"/> the hope of profit from them or theirs; in which regard, one of them excuſed himſelfe, ſaying, that if he had ſaid any thing againſt the deſigne of the <hi>Pope,</hi> he had much endamaged himſelfe without any furtherance to the <hi>Republique.</hi> And it is a thing without doubt in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the
<hi>Cardinals</hi> voices are taken in <hi>Conſiſtorie</hi> onely in apparence and by way of ceremonie, in aſ much as they are neuer informed of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire whereof they are to treat, but of the fact alone which is preſented; or at the moſt they haue no further information then thoſe few words which the <hi>Pope</hi> is pleaſed to ſpeake two ſeuerall times in
<hi>Conſiſtorie,</hi> as hath beene ſaid. And not ſeldome matters are propounded whereof they neuer heard word. So that the <hi>Popes</hi> goe with aſſurance to propound in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtorie</hi> whatſoeuer is to their humour, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon the cuſtome which is among the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> to conſent to all that which is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; which is openly derided in the
<hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> changing the <hi>Latine</hi> word (by the figure of agnomination) <hi>aſſentiri</hi> into <hi>aſſentari.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Conſiſtorie</hi> thus finiſhed, the
<hi>Monitorie</hi> was affixed in the accuſtomed places of the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and incontinently ſcattered euery
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:17285:46"/> where, an infinite number of <hi>Copies</hi> being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, partly in <hi>Latine,</hi> and partly in the
<hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> which were ſent thorowout all the Cities of
<hi>Italie;</hi> and into the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> it ſelfe, were diſperſed a great quantity which had been ſent vnto the
<hi>Ieſuites</hi> &amp; other <hi>Religious</hi> (which tooke part with the
<hi>Pope,)</hi> as alſo to their friends, accompanying them with ſeditious let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And thus they continued ſending during ſome weekes, in forme of pacquets or blancs with inſcription to any whomſoeuer whoſe name they knew. One thing was much wondred at, that in the vulgar <hi>Copie</hi> printed in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> this clauſe of the impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the
<hi>Abbot</hi> and the <hi>Canon</hi> had beene adioyned [And haue committed the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their cauſe vnto the <hi>Secular Magiſtrate</hi> of the
<hi>Signiory</hi> named the <hi>Auogardor,]</hi> which clauſe was not in the

            <p>The <hi>Monitorie</hi> was addreſſed to the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches, Archbiſhops, Biſhops,</hi> their <hi>Vicars Generall,</hi> and to all the

               <hi>Eſtate</hi> of the <hi>Republique</hi> of
<hi>Venice.</hi> The <hi>Pope</hi> by this <hi>Monitorie</hi> declared, that ſome <hi>Months</hi> before it was come to his knowledge, that the
<hi>Duke</hi> and <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> ſome yeeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had made ſome <hi>Decrees</hi> contrary to the authoritie of the <hi>See Apoſtolique,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Ecclefiaſticall</hi> immunitie: repugnant vnto the <hi>Generall Councels,</hi> to the <hi>Canons</hi> and
<hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions</hi> of <hi>Popes;</hi> and ſpecially he made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the firſt place of that ordinance in the yeere M DC II. by which
<hi>Ecclefiaſticall</hi> perſons were forbidden to receiue or purchaſe goods immoueable, vnder ſhadow that themſelues were thereof the direct
<hi>Lords,</hi> their right not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding being not hereby impeached. In the ſecond place he mentioned that of the yeere M DC III. by which the prohibition to build Churches or other places of deuotion without leaue, was extended to all the <hi>State.</hi> In the third place, that of the yeere M DC V. which in like manner extended to all the <hi>State,</hi> a prohibition to alienate for euer any goods immoueable <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> or <hi>Lay,</hi> to men of the <hi>Church.</hi> In the fourth place he ſpake of the reſtraint of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> of <hi>Viçença,</hi> and the
<hi>Abbot</hi> of <hi>Nerueſe;</hi> adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that ſome of thoſe Lawes aboliſhed the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17285:47"/> rights which the <hi>Church</hi> had euer inioyed, and tended to the preiudice of his authoritie, of the rights of the
<hi>Church,</hi> and of the priuiledges of perſons
<hi>Ecclefiaſticall,</hi> in briefe of <hi>Ecclefiaſticall</hi> liberty, all of them tending to the danger of the ſoules both of the <hi>Duke</hi> and of all the <hi>Senators,</hi> and alſo to the great ſcandall of many others. That they which had made theſe Lawes had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred the Cenſures &amp; the confiſcation of their fiefs, from which they could not be abſolued but by the <hi>Pope,</hi> and by reuoking firſt all theſe ſtatutes and ordinances, and by reſtoring all things into the former eſtate. But foraſmuch as the <hi>Duke</hi> and <hi>Senate</hi> after ſundry fatherly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions had not daigned to reuoke their Lawes, or to render the Priſoners, he who might not in any ſort endure that
<hi>Ecclefiaſticall</hi> liberty and immunitie together with the authoritie of the <hi>See Apoſtolique</hi> ſhould be violated, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the example of ten of his predeceſſors there recited &amp; many others, with the counſell &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> after mature deliberation, although the Decrees aforeſaid were of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues void and of no value; neuertheleſſe hee did now declare them to be ſuch. And further he did Excommunicate, declare &amp; pronounce
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17285:47"/> for Excommunicated, as if they had beene par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly named, the <hi>Duke</hi> and the <hi>Senate</hi> which then were, and which ſhould be hereafter, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all their fauourers, counſellors, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, if within the terme of foure and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie daies, to be counted from the day of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication (which he appointed in three termes, each of eight daies) the <hi>Duke</hi> and the <hi>Senate</hi> did not reuoke, abrogate, and diſannull the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees aforeſaid, and all that which had followed thereupon, without any exception or excuſe; and if they cauſed not to be openly in all places publiſhed that abrogation of the Lawes, and the reſtitution of all that which had beene done in conſequence thereof, with promiſe not to doe any more ſuch acts for the time to come; and to giue account of all theſe things to himſelfe, as alſo actually render into the hands of his <hi>Nuntio</hi> the <hi>Canon</hi> and the
<hi>Abbot:</hi> That from this Excommunication they could not be abſolued but by the <hi>Pope,</hi> except it were in the point of death, in which caſe if any one receiuing abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution ſhould afterwards recouer his health, he ſhould againe fall within this ſame Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication if he did not (ſo farre as in him lay) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey this his commandement: That vntill they
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17285:48"/> had obeyed, he did forbid to bury any one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed in holy places. And if after the foure and twenty daies the
<hi>Duke</hi> and <hi>Senate</hi> ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue three daies longer obſtinate, he put all their <hi>State</hi> vnder the <hi>Interdict,</hi> in ſuch ſort that none might celebrate <hi>Maſſes</hi> or Diuine Seruices, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in forme, in places and caſes granted by common right. And he depriued the <hi>Duke</hi> and <hi>Senate</hi> of all their goods which they held of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of other <hi>Churches,</hi> as alſo of all their Priuiledges and indults obtained by it, and ſpecially of that priuiledge inabling them to proceed againſt <hi>Clarkes</hi> in certaine ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; reſeruing to Himſelfe and his Succeſſors power to aggrauate and reaggrauate the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and penalties againſt them and againſt their adherents, fauourers, counſellers &amp; others, and to paſſe vnto other paines and remedies, if they perſiſted in their contempt, not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding &amp;c.

               <hi>D'Alincourt, Ambaſſador</hi> of the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King,</hi> did the ſame Office, but as from himſelfe; to whoſe demands the <hi>Pope</hi> would not condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, but anſwered, that he ought rather to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the <hi>Republique</hi> to obey: wherefore he gaue aduiſe to the

<hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> could not containe himſelfe, but replied, that the word <hi>(Obey)</hi> was too harſh to be vſed towards a Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
<hi>Prince,</hi> and that a delay in this caſe would in the end be found very behouefull. The great <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> alſo writ to the

            <p>After the publication of the <hi>Monitory,</hi> the
<hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors</hi> of the <hi>Republique</hi> were viſited by the
<hi>Ambaſſadours</hi> of the <hi>Emperour,</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>France,</hi> and of the great <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Tuſcany;</hi> who communicated vnto them, what they had done with the <hi>Pope,</hi> and how they found him ſtill in his firſt reſolution.</p>
            <p>Some men were of opinion, that the <hi>Pope,</hi> according to the cuſtome of thoſe that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out experience, quickly after the
<hi>Monitory</hi> had beene publiſhed, the heat of his courage being a little tempered, would ſeriouſly conſider the inconueniences which in all reaſon he might ſee would follow, and hereby beginning to relent, would deſire an occaſion to prolong the terme,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17285:50"/> if he were thereunto required by the
<hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</hi> Others ſaid, it was likely that by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of
<hi>Princes</hi> and their <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> alone he would giue longer terme, if he did beleeue that the <hi>Republique</hi> would accept it. Which might haue beene for his aduantage, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that by this meanes a way had beene ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to cauſe his commandements to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. But the
<hi>Pope</hi> remained firme, reſolued to ſee the iſſue of his
<hi>Monitorie:</hi> the publication whereof being knowne at <hi>Venice,</hi> it was firſt by the <hi>Senate</hi> ordered that all ſhould haue recourſe to their praiers, &amp; command was ſent to al <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Monaſteries</hi> as well of men as women, and other places of deuotion, to make oriſons and ſupplications, following the ancient vſage, and a good ſumme of money was alſo diſtributed in almes to theſe holy places. Then after they deliberated vpon the Gouernment, and conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted whether it were meet to leaue their <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> or to call them home. Some were of opinion that they ſhould be recalled, ſince that the
<hi>Republique</hi> hauing receiued ſo great an iniury, could not with any honour keepe them at <hi>Rome.</hi> Others conſidered that to call them away were vtterly to breake off all communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:17285:50"/> In the end both opinions were appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and both the one and the other followed, with this temperament: They reſolued to call home onely the extraordinarie <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſufficiently teſtifying their ſenſibleneſſe of the wrong: but to leaue the Ordinary, to doe all offices of piety and reuerence towards the
<hi>See Apoſtolique,</hi> and to preuent an abſolute rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which they would auoid till they were forced by an extreme violence. It was alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, to communicate all theſe matters to the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> to whom (till then) they had not imparted any of theſe things, for conſiderations which hinder to treat with him vpon points controuerted with the <hi>Pope.</hi> And accordingly they writ to <hi>Gregory Iuſtiniano Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador</hi> of the <hi>Repub.</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> that he ſhould informe the <hi>King. Henry Wotton</hi> the <hi>Engliſh Ambaſſador</hi> at <hi>Venice</hi> complained with words of courteſie that they had communicated theſe things to other <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> ſo long before him: but for the pretenſions of the <hi>Pope,</hi> he ſaid, that he could not vnderſtand this <hi>Romane Theologie</hi> which is contrary to all iuſtice and honeſty.</p>
            <p>Now to the end that they might prouide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the inconueniences which the <hi>Popes Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitorie</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:17285:51"/> might cauſe, command was giuen to all
<hi>Prelates</hi> and <hi>Ecclefiasticall</hi> perſons, that they ſhould not publiſh or permit to be publiſhed or affixed in any place whereſoeuer, any <hi>Bulls, Breues,</hi> or other writings which might be ſent vnto them. Furthermore, proclamation was made, vnder paine of incurring the diſpleaſure of the <hi>Prince,</hi> that whoſoeuer had any
<hi>Copie</hi> of a certaine <hi>Breue</hi> publiſhed at <hi>Rome</hi> againſt the <hi>Republique,</hi> ſhould bring it vnto the
<hi>Magiſtrates</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> or to the Gouernours of Cities and other places of their <hi>State;</hi> to which all men did ſo cheerefully obey and brought out ſo many copies, that it was a thing maruellous to ſee what quantitie had beene imprinted; neither was any one any where affixed, by reaſon of the generall diligence of all the people, who diſcouered in diuers places and cauſed to arreſt thoſe who came for that effect. They imparted likewiſe to all the <hi>Agents</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi> which were then at <hi>Venice,</hi> the reaſons and cauſes of theſe motions; and the ſame was written to all the Reſidents for the <hi>Republique</hi> with
<hi>Princes.</hi> It was alſo thought fit by the <hi>Senate,</hi> to write to all Gouernours of Cities and places within their <hi>State,</hi> and to giue them aduice of the iniurie
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17285:51"/> which the <hi>Republique</hi> had receiued and did dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiue from the <hi>Pope;</hi> as alſo the pregnant reaſons which they had in their defence, with order that theſe letters ſhould be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Conſuls</hi> &amp; Communalties of their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Which being done, euery where were ſeene the effects of an incredible obedience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion towards their <hi>Prince,</hi> with great reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to defend and maintaine the publique liberty, for aid whereof they offered ſuccour of men, of money and armes, according to the abilitie of each place: and theſe offers were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards performed, in their time, with the ſame promptitude and cheerefulneſſe.</p>
            <p>During this time, <hi>Duodo</hi> the extraordinarie
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of the <hi>Signiory</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> receiued commandement to depart. He tooke leaue of the <hi>Pope</hi> the 27. of the
<hi>Moneth,</hi> telling him, that ſeeing he could not obtaine of his
<hi>Holineſſe</hi> to take into his conſideration the reaſons by him repreſented, and hauing no more to ſay or doe, he was called backe to
<hi>Venice.</hi> The <hi>Pope</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him with words of courteſie towards himſelfe, and touching the difference, ſaid, that he had done nothing but what his conſcience obliged him to doe; that the caſe was cleare
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:17285:52"/> and decided; that in the whole order of his proceedings he had followed the example of his Predeceſſors: that his weapons in this quarrell were ſpirituall, the vſe whereof accorded well with that fatherly loue which he had euer ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the <hi>Republique,</hi> requiring onely ſuch obedience as all <hi>Princes</hi> are bound to render vnto him.</p>
            <p>But at <hi>Venice</hi> the <hi>Nuntio</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> after he had receiued aduice that the <hi>Monitorie</hi> was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, euery day frequented the houſe of the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> where were then
<hi>Fathers</hi> of great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie amongſt them for their actions paſſed in the moſt important affaires of <hi>State:</hi> among the reſt, were Father <hi>Bernardine Caſtorius</hi> of <hi>Sie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> their
<hi>Superior,</hi> who was <hi>Prouinciall</hi> at <hi>Lyons</hi> at what time the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> were baniſhed thence: Father <hi>Anthony Poſſeuine</hi> of great renowne for the things by him managed in
<hi>Moſcouia</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia,</hi> not only whilſt he was in perſon in thoſe countries, but afterwards by his ſleights and treaties: Father
<hi>Iohn Baro</hi> a <hi>Venetian,</hi> a man greatly enterpriſing, not permitting that in any Citie where hee made his reſidence any thing ſhould paſſe of moment without his preſence: Father <hi>Iohn Gentes</hi> much verſed in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:17285:52"/> (as they call it) of Caſes of Conſcience, apt to condemne and reprehend any action whatſoeuer, if it were not done with their knowledge and counſell, as alſo to uſtifie all the actions of their Obedients: beſides many other Fathers, all zealous practiſers of their fourth vow.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Nuntio</hi> hauing aduice of the <hi>Interdict,</hi> came not in <hi>Senate</hi> till the 28. of the ſame <hi>Moneth,</hi> where firſt ſhewing a great diſpleaſure for what was paſſed, he added that they ought not to proceed towards his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> with ſo much repugnance; that the <hi>Pope</hi> was moued by pure zeale; and that yet (if they would yeeld a little) all things might be accorded. And to this effect he deſired that his <hi>Serenitie</hi> would deuiſe ſome temperament: that for his part he offred his interuention to repreſent it, and to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour it. But to the end that his diſcourſe might ſeeme more paſſionate, and be more perſwaſiue, the <hi>Nuntio</hi> ſeaſoned it with many words of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and ſpake often of <hi>God,</hi> vſing theſe termes <hi>[our Lord,]</hi> of which alſo he ſerued himſelfe when he ſpake of the
<hi>Pope;</hi> which made his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ambiguous to the hearers, excepting ſome more prudent who had formerly obſerued
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17285:53"/> in other actions, and at that time tooke notice, that in pronouncing theſe words <hi>[Our Lord]</hi> if he meant the
<hi>Pope</hi> he would vncouer his head, but when he ſpake it of
<hi>God,</hi> he held on his bonnet. To this diſcourſe mixt of affaires and ſimplicitie, made in forme of a <hi>Sermon,</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> anſwered: That none of found vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding could approue it, that a
<hi>Common-wealth</hi> ſo pious and Catholique ſhould be on ſuch a faſhion vexed: that the actions of the <hi>Pope</hi> could not be iuſtified. He complained likewiſe that he had not deigned to heare their
<hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> Extraordinary: that he had publiſhed a
<hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitorie</hi> eſteemed vniuſt by euery one without any ſcruple, and that he came to ſo important a reſolution without knowing before how the world is gouerned; that his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> could not haue done an act more proper for to put the <hi>See Apoſtolique</hi> vpon the cenſure and hatred of all the world, and in a manifeſt perill that if the
<hi>Republique</hi> ſhould hereupon ſeparate from the <hi>Pope,</hi> this ſeparation ſhould be followed with a loſſe irreparable to the
<hi>Eccleſiastiques.</hi> But that the <hi>Repub.</hi> would not depart from their piety, yet would defend themſelues; that for him, he did well to perſwade peace, but that he ſhould
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17285:53"/> turne his ſpeech to the <hi>Pope</hi> who troubled it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Nuntio</hi> hearing this, made ſome inſtance to haue anſwer likewiſe from the <hi>Senate,</hi> and tooke leaue. The
<hi>Senate</hi> eight daies afterward anſwered him in the ſame manner as the <hi>Duke</hi> had done: whith he vnderſtanding, beginning with the ſame vnſeaſonable complaints, which at other times he had vſed, he paſſed further and made appeare his diſpleaſure, in that he could not finde any temperament, concluding that the <hi>Senate</hi> ſhould take heed, leſt whiles they deſired to ſuſtaine a particular Law, they might draw on themſelues an vniuerſall ruine. To which the <hi>Duke</hi> anſwered, that he ought to ſpeake of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> who had vſed ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation, and that he ſhould doe well to ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes the imminent perils which might follow hereupon, with the neceſſitie to auoid them by deſiſting from his iniuries; that theſe counſells came from an old man many yeares imployed in the affaires of <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> knowing the <hi>Proclamation</hi> made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his <hi>Monitory,</hi> &amp; the reſolution of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of the
<hi>State,</hi> who were then moſt ready to ſerue their <hi>Prince,</hi> &amp; to maintaine their Liberty, being therefore out of hope that his
<hi>Interdict</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:17285:54"/> would be obſerued, he thought that his
<hi>Nuntio</hi> could not any longer continue at <hi>Venice,</hi> with his honour. And therfore he writ vnto him, ſpeedily to depart, &amp; the ſixt of <hi>May</hi> he ſent the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Soana</hi> to giue diſmiſſion vnto <hi>Nani</hi> the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Reſident</hi> of the
<hi>Republique,</hi> charging him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely not to leaue behind him at
<hi>Rome</hi> any one of his Company. Notwithſtading the <hi>Pope</hi> deſired to ſee him before his departure, and therefore the
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> hauing ſent to demand Audience the day following, he granted him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently. But after, either becauſe hee was ſo perſwaded by other, or of his owne motion, and peraduenture for feare leſt he ſhould make ſome Proteſtation, he ſent vnto him early in the morning the <hi>Maſter of the Ceremonies,</hi> to tell him that he would not receiue him in quality of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour,</hi> but that he might come as a priuate man, and ſo he would receiue and welcome him gladly. <hi>Nani</hi> made anſwer, that he knew not how he ſhould ſeparate from his Perſon the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> and much leſſe could he doe this without knowledge of his <hi>Prince,</hi> whoſe Perſon he repreſented: and therefore ſince it would not pleaſe his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> to ſee him as <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador,</hi> he was ready to be gone. The <hi>Master
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:17285:54"/> of the Ceremonies</hi> reported this anſwer to the <hi>Pope,</hi> who ſent him backe againe to <hi>Nani,</hi> with reſolution that he would not receiue him in qualitie of
<hi>Ambaſſador.</hi> There were alreadie with him many <hi>Prelates</hi> and other perſons for to accompany him vnto the Audience; ſome whereof, hauing knowledge of the reſolution of his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> and of the
<hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> purpoſe thereupon to depart, demanded of the
<hi>Maſter</hi> of the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> whether they might accompany him, whereunto he anſwered as of himſelfe, that it ſeemed to him not conuenient: it fell out that all their Caroaches followed the
<hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> but few <hi>Prelates</hi> accompanied him in Perſon. Yet ſome few went along with him, moued by ſome reſpects. But the
<hi>Count Iohn Francis de Gambara,</hi> although he was a <hi>Prelate</hi> of no great time, and by conſequent his hopes being ſo much the greater, as they were more freſh, and who him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe had imployed the <hi>Pope</hi> for Interceſſor to the <hi>Republique,</hi> for the deliuerance of the
<hi>Count Hannibal</hi> his brother from the Ban which hee had incurred, which yet hee was not able to obtaine, not without ſome indignation of his
<hi>Holineſſe,</hi> yet did not omit to accompany the
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> in Perſon, ſaying that no occaſion
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17285:55"/> was ſufficient to make him forget his dutie; whoſe action and words might iuſtly cauſe them to bluſh for ſhame, who being obliged by moſt ſtrait bonds, were very forward to faile in their dutie. The <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> then departed Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably accompanied, for as much as the bruit of his departure being ſcattered thorow <hi>Rome,</hi> all they of the Nation reſorted to him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the <hi>Barons</hi> and <hi>Romane</hi> Gentlemen affected to the <hi>Republique.</hi> But the
<hi>Pope</hi> on the morrow diſpatched after him a <hi>Colonell</hi> to accompany him thorow-out the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> who ouertooke him at <hi>Foligno,</hi> and offered to attend him, in the name of his <hi>Holineſſe.</hi> The <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi> though he was well accompanied, receiued notwithſtanding the <hi>Colonell,</hi> for a part of the way, and then thanking his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> ſent him backe, (who returned,) and was well entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in all places of the <hi>State Eccleſiaſticall</hi> as he paſſed.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time, the chiefe of the <hi>Councell</hi> of Ten ſent for the <hi>Superiours</hi> of <hi>Monaſteries,</hi> and other
<hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Venice;</hi> to whom was made knowne that the intention of the <hi>Prince</hi> was that they ſhould continue the Diuine
<hi>Seruices,</hi> and that none of them ſhould depart out of the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17285:55"/> 
               <hi>State</hi> without permiſſion; Protection was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to them that would remain, and for them that would be gone it was declared that they might not carry away any goods of the
<hi>Church,</hi> nor any other thing of value. They were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commanded, that if any <hi>Breue</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> or any order from their
<hi>Superiours</hi> were by any meanes ſent vnto them, they ſhould bring it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> before they reade it. In like manner the
<hi>Gouernours</hi> of all Cities within the <hi>State</hi> were commanded to doe the like thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all places of their Iuriſdiction. After they conſulted whether it were meet to make anſwer vnto the <hi>Monitory.</hi> There were that propoſed, to vſe the remedy of Appeale practiſed in all times by all <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Republiques,</hi> eſpecially within theſe laſt three hundred yeares, againſt the attempts of <hi>Popes,</hi> and particularly by the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> vpon like occaſions, and in like occurrences, yea euen ſince that the <hi>Popes, Pius</hi> 2. <hi>Sixtus</hi> 4. and <hi>Iulius</hi> 2. by their
<hi>Breues,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by the <hi>Bulle in Coena Domini,</hi> haue aſſayed to condemne ſuch Appeales. Others neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe alledging that Appeales are made in caſe of an iniuſtice, which hath ſome colour of iuſtice, which hath no place in this <hi>Monitory,</hi> where the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17285:56"/> nullities were in great numbers, and ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, their aduiſe was receiued. Wherefore it was reſolued with one conſent, to write vnto the <hi>Prelates</hi> of the <hi>State,</hi> touching the iudgement of the <hi>Prince,</hi> concerning the <hi>Monitory</hi> publiſhed, and why he determined to vſe no other remedy. Theſe Letters were written the ſixt of <hi>May,</hi> and were imprinted to be affixed in publique places, and contained in ſubſtance; that he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued aduiſe of a Publication made at <hi>Rome</hi> on the ſeuenteenth of <hi>Aprill,</hi> of a certaine <hi>Breue</hi> ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated againſt him, and againſt the
<hi>Senate</hi> and <hi>Signory;</hi> wherefore being obliged to haue a care of the publique tranquillitie, and of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of a <hi>Soueraigne Prince,</hi> he Proteſted before <hi>God</hi> and all the world, that he had not omitted or neglected any meanes poſſible to make the <hi>Pope</hi> capable of the moſt cleare and ſtrong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in behalfe of the
<hi>Republique.</hi> But hauing found his cares ſhut, and ſeene that
<hi>Breue</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed againſt reaſon and iuſtice, and againſt the doctrine of the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and of the
<hi>Canons,</hi> in preiudice of the <hi>Secular</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie giuen by
<hi>God,</hi> and of the libertie of the <hi>State,</hi> with the trouble of the repoſe of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and to the great ſcandall of all the world;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17285:56"/> he did not doubt to account that <hi>Breue</hi> not onely for vniuſt, but for meerely void and null, and ſo vnlawfull that he did not repute it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to haue recourſe to ſuch remedies as in other occaſions the <hi>Republique</hi> and many <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Princes</hi> haue vſed againſt ſuch <hi>Popes</hi> as outpaſſed the power to them giuen by <hi>God;</hi> truſting, that the <hi>Prelates</hi> would hold on in their accuſtomed courſes, and continue the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſeruice, the
<hi>Republique</hi> being reſolued to perſeuere in the holy
<hi>Catholique</hi> faith, and in the reuerence of the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> ſuch as they had from the beginning euer tendered.</p>
            <p>Vpon this there hapned a thing notable: Vpon the 8. of <hi>May</hi> the ſame time that the <hi>Nuntio</hi> was with the <hi>Prince</hi> to demand leaue to be gone, were affixed thorowout the Citie Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the foreſaid letters, and as he returned he ſaw one faſtned to the doore of <hi>S. Francis Church</hi> which was hard by his lodging.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Capuchins</hi> and <hi>Theatins</hi> vntill then did not thinke of departing out of the <hi>State,</hi> or at the leaſt they did not diſcouer their deſigne; on the contrary, the <hi>Prouinciall</hi> and other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the <hi>Capucines</hi> (which gouerned one of their
<hi>Prouinces</hi> which they haue within the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17285:57"/> 
               <hi>State)</hi> when they vnderſtood that the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Monitorie</hi> was made at <hi>Rome,</hi> tooke counſell among themſelues, and determined that, ſeeing no matter of faith was treated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Republique,</hi> they were not obliged to follow the intentions of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and to this effect (following this reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) they ſent letters to all their
<hi>Conuents</hi> ſituate within the <hi>State.</hi> Afterwards, receiuing an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe command from their <hi>Superiors</hi> that by all meanes they ſhould be gone and retire out of the <hi>Venetian Dominions,</hi> they wrought in ſuch ſort that they were prohibited to depart vpon paine of death, and procured this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to be generall, to the end that they might be leſſe ſuſpected: which being done, they raiſed and ſpred a rumour, that they had an intention to retire, but now they could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forbidden by the <hi>Prince</hi> vnder paine of death. But afterward they vtterly changed their opinion vpon the occaſion which followes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> immediatly after they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that the
<hi>Monitorie</hi> had beene publiſhed in <hi>Rome,</hi> diſpatched to his
<hi>Holineſſe</hi> the Father <hi>Achilles Gaillardi</hi> of <hi>Padua</hi> for to repreſent vnto him what good offices they might doe to his
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:17285:57"/> aduantage if they were permitted to remaine within the <hi>State.</hi> For this reaſon, expecting here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of an anſwer from <hi>Rome,</hi> when the pleaſure of the <hi>Senate</hi> was ſignified vnto them, they ſpake in apparence as did others: neuertheleſſe either becauſe they were in doubt of the <hi>Popes</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or for ſome other reaſon, ſeruing themſelues of their ordinary equiuocations, they profeſſed that they might continue the Diuine Offices, their Sermons &amp; Confeſſions, according to their cuſtome. But the <hi>Pope</hi> hearing the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> and conſidering that if they did not publikely keepe the <hi>Interdict,</hi> they would bring more damage to his pretenſions then profit by their ſleights which they could practiſe vnder hand, hee gaue them to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that his reſolution was they ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the <hi>Interdict;</hi> and for this effect ſent vnto them a commandement by the ſame <hi>Currier</hi> which brought vnto the
<hi>Nuntio</hi> his order to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, yet that they might delay ſo long as they could with conuenience. Notwithſtanding they ſcattered a report that they had decreed to ſtay, abſtaining only from ſaying <hi>Maſſe</hi> in publique, but otherwiſe to continue all Diuine Offices. And foraſmuch as it ſeemed a great diminution
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17285:58"/> of their reputation, if when they went away, the
<hi>Capuchines</hi> ſhould abide; after they had vſed many artifices to make them depart, as well by meanes of the <hi>Nuntio</hi> as of another Miniſter of a certaine <hi>Prince,</hi> who for foure daies ſpace han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their <hi>Couent</hi> at laſt they gained them, by ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting, that all the world would caſt their eyes vpon the <hi>Capuchines,</hi> and that their reſolution would be a definitiue ſentence of the validitie or inualiditie of the <hi>Monitorie.</hi> Wherefore ſince their opinion would be infallibly followed and embraced by all the world, they now had a faire occaſion offered to merit much of the <hi>Holy See.</hi> Which did puffe them vp in ſuch ſort, that they went to the <hi>Prince,</hi> to declare vnto him that they could not remaine, and Father <hi>Theodore de Bergamaſco,</hi> the Companion of the <hi>Prouinciall,</hi> paſſed ſo far as that he had the boldneſſe to ſay that their condition was much differing from the condition of the other <hi>Religious,</hi> whoſe actions were of ſmall importance: but the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchins</hi> ought to be the rule of all the reſt, all the world hauing an eye to them for to take exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whether to eſteeme the <hi>Popes</hi> Cenſures or to contemne them.</p>
            <p>Now the terme of 24. daies prefixed in the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:17285:58"/> 
               <hi>Monitorie</hi> approaching, the
<hi>Ieſuites</hi> were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the 9. of <hi>May</hi> to giue a certaine reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; who then declared their equiuocation, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to ſay
<hi>Maſſe,</hi> which they ſaid was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their former promiſe, inaſmuch as the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> for the excellencie of it, is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnder the name of Diuine Offices. And certes it was a pretty inuention, to offer themſelues to doe Diuine Seruices, and then after to exclude the <hi>Maſſe</hi> becauſe of its excellence, and all others likewiſe becauſe they had not wont to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate them, and ſo by this ſhift to promiſe all things and performe nothing to the
<hi>Republique;</hi> as alſo to abide within the <hi>State,</hi> and yet withall to keepe the <hi>Interdict</hi> according to the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the
<hi>Pope.</hi> Hereupon the ſame day the point was put in conſultation, and it was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in full <hi>Senate</hi> to ſend the <hi>Grand Vicar</hi> of the <hi>Patriarke</hi> for to receiue and take into his charge all the ornaments and iewels of the <hi>Church,</hi> with commandement vnto the
<hi>Ieſuites</hi> that they ſhould ſpeedily auoid the Countrey. Letters alſo were written to the Gouernours of Cities, that they ſhould cauſe them to depart from the places of their Iuriſdiction. The
<hi>Ieſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> vnderſtanding this reſolution, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:17285:59"/> tumultuouſly vnto the <hi>Church</hi> their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted ones, from whom they drew a very great ſumme of money; and perſwaded the <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines,</hi> that at their parting, they ſhould goe forth in Proceſſion with the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> ſeditiouſly intending to moue the people, if it had been poſſible. And the euening being come, they demanded of the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> to be aſſiſted by publique Officers for their ſecuritie, which was accorded vnto them. But here with not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting themſelues, they ſent to requeſt the
<hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> that it would pleaſe him to let them be attended by his Seruants, which he did not thinke fit, ſeeing they had already a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like guard. In the end, that euening they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted two houres within night, each one carying the <hi>Holy Hoſt</hi> at his necke, to intimate that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> departed with them: &amp; to this ſpectacle there were aſſembled a great. multitude of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as well by land as by water. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior,</hi> who laſt of al entred the Barque, dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded Benediction of the <hi>Viccar</hi> of the <hi>Patriarch,</hi> who was there, ſtraight a voice was raiſed by all the people, crying in the language of that <hi>Country, Andè in mall' hora, Goe with a vengeance,</hi> or in <hi>the Deuils name.</hi> Theſe men in the meane while had
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:17285:59"/> hid in the Citie, veſſels and precious ornaments of the <hi>Church,</hi> many bookes, and the beſt moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables of their <hi>Houſe,</hi> which they left in a manner void. All the next day there remained the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes of a fire in two places where they had bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned an incredible quantitie of writings. They left alſo a good number of cruſes to melt met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, the noiſe whereof being heard thorow the Citie, which ſcandalized the few deuoted ones which were left there, the <hi>Father Poſſeuine</hi> writ (and his letter was publikely ſeene) that theſe cruſes were not to melt gold or ſiluer, as they were ſlandred, but only for to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modate their bonnets. Shortly, there remained not any thing of importance within the <hi>Houſe,</hi> ſaue the <hi>Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> bequeathed vnto them by the <hi>Arch-Biſhop Leuys Molino Biſhop</hi> of
<hi>Treuiſo,</hi> which was found with in their Armories, and a caſe of bookes forbidden, in a place ſeparate. But at <hi>Padua</hi> were found many Copies of a certaine Writing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining eighteene rules vnder this title,
<hi>Regulae aliquot ſeruandae vt cum Orthodoxâ Eccleſiâ verè ſentiamus,</hi> that is to ſay, Rules which ought to be obſerued, to the end that our Beleefe may be conformable to that of the
<hi>Orthodox Church:</hi> in the ſeuenteenth whereof there is a preſcription
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17285:60"/> to take heed how men preſſe or inculcate too much the grace of <hi>God:</hi> and in the third it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that men muſt beleeue the <hi>Hierarchicall Church,</hi> although it tell vs that that is blacke, which our eye iudgeth to be white. Before their parting, they left vnto their Penitents ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, how they ought to gouerne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in the obſeruation of the <hi>Interdict.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Ieſuites</hi> being thus gone, there ſeemed ſmall cauſe of feare for the other <hi>Religious</hi> that they would breed any trouble. But vpon the bruit which ran of the <hi>Capuchines</hi> and
<hi>Theatines,</hi> who ſaid that they muſt needs keepe the
<hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,</hi> there were ſome that imputed this manner of proceeding in them to a feebleneſſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, eaſie to be deceiued, and ſo condoled with them, and deſired they might be tolerated. Others more aduiſed, ſeeing well that this did proceed from their ambition to ſeem better than others, with deſigne to be fauoured by his
<hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,</hi> deteſted their hypocriſie. But the <hi>Senate</hi> reputing it not agreeable to that reaſon and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice which they vſed in matters of <hi>State,</hi> nor to the ſeruice of <hi>God</hi> and tranquillitie of Religion; and that on the contrary in times ſo calamitous, ſuch a noueltie might bring much danger, if
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:17285:60"/> within the <hi>State</hi> it were permitted that any <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtique</hi> ſhould obſerue the <hi>Iuterdict,</hi> gaue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that all thoſe who were not diſpoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Diuine Seruices ſhould retire out of their Dominions. Whereupon the <hi>Capuchines, Theatines,</hi> and the reformed <hi>Franciſcanes</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from
<hi>Venice,</hi> and others <hi>Religious</hi> were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the Gouernment of their <hi>Churches.</hi> But the <hi>Capuchines</hi> in the Territories of <hi>Breſcia</hi> and <hi>Bergamo,</hi> where there were no
<hi>Ieſuites</hi> to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them, did not accord with the other, but remained and continued their <hi>Diuine Seruices</hi> without any innouation, for which they were bitterly perſecuted by their <hi>Superiours</hi> at
<hi>Rome</hi> with Excommunications and other Spirituall penalties, although without effect as touching their Temporalls, becauſe the <hi>Prince</hi> had taken them into his protection: and for the Spirituals, they defended themſelues by ſome Writings which were publiſhed, vpon very good grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, being men well learned and of great prudence, who were not carried to take any reſolution but with the ſafety of their conſciences. The
<hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> according to the intention of the
<hi>Ieſuites,</hi> would haue gone out with ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, thereby to moue a tumult; but being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17285:61"/> hindered, they celebrated that morning only one
<hi>Maſſe,</hi> and conſumed all the holy <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the
<hi>Euchariſt,</hi> which was preſerued in their <hi>Church,</hi> and concluded the <hi>Maſſe</hi> without giuing Benediction vnto the people. They left alſo to their <hi>Deuotes</hi> diuers inſtructions for to obſerue the <hi>Interdict,</hi> as did likewiſe the <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</hi> But in ſuch a confuſion, and in ſo great haſte, being not able to conſult together, they did not well accord with the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> diſagreed amongſt themſelues; whence it came to paſſe that their adherents proceeded diuerſly, ſome being of opinion that all the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi> adminiſtred by the
<hi>Prieſts</hi> that ſtayed were nullities, and therefore that it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to adore the holy <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> as before: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eſteemed that to heare <hi>Maſſe</hi> was only a veniall ſinne, and others held it a ſin moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, although the <hi>Sacrament</hi> were truely cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated. Of theſe inſtructions, and of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent wayes of obſeruing them are yet to bee ſeene the Writings publiſhed by their Fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ieſuites</hi> being departed, retired them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to
<hi>Ferrara, Bologna,</hi> and <hi>Mantua,</hi> neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring places, where they might receiue the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:17285:61"/> conſulations of their friends, and readily ſend their anſwers; as alſo employ themſelues to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite more eaſily ſome ſedition, whether by their emiſſaries, or by their frequent letters. The other <hi>Religious</hi> likewiſe which were gone, retired in like maner to <hi>Milan, Ferrara,</hi> &amp; <hi>Bologne,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> where they were ſeene with an euill eye by the other
<hi>Religious</hi> of the ſame Orders, as thoſe who were come to ſpend part of their commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities. And the <hi>Superiours</hi> of Houſes complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that though by this meanes the mouthes were doubled, yet the
<hi>Pope</hi> had not ſent any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prouiſion but <hi>Indulgences;</hi> and they ſaid openly, that if other ſuccour did not come from
<hi>Rome,</hi> they could not continue to make ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, nor to furniſh ſo many perſons with Veſtiments. And it is certaine that the
<hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchines,</hi> which departed out of the <hi>State</hi> of
<hi>Venice</hi> to the number of eight hundred, could not finde (at leaſt all of them) any conuenient retrait, ſo as many of them died for want of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Venice</hi> they communicated to all
<hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> and <hi>Agents</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> all that had paſſed, and alſo writ vnto the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the
<hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> in all <hi>Courts;</hi> how that the <hi>Nuntio</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:17285:62"/> that their <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> had been diſmiſſed; that the <hi>Republique</hi> iudged all things done here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by the <hi>Pope,</hi> meere nullities; that they were reſolued to liue
<hi>Catholiques,</hi> and to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Rome</hi> men held for conſtant that the
<hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitorie</hi> would cauſe three notable effects. The firſt, that the
<hi>Religious</hi> would all depart the Countrey, and ſo the
<hi>Interdict</hi> at leaſt by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie ſhould be obſerued. The ſecond, that the Cities and people ſeeing themſelues depriued of Diuine Offices &amp; Exerciſes would ſeditiouſly be moued and ſend to the
<hi>Prince</hi> to giue ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to his <hi>Holineſſe.</hi> The third that vpon this occaſion the <hi>Nobilitie</hi> might be diſordered, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and terrified, &amp; ſo diuided amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Vpon theſe hopes and conſiderations they ſuffered to ſlip not onely the foure and twenty daies before determined, but many more; during which the
<hi>Ieſuites,</hi> tho abſent, put in worke all their artifices. But they ſaw at <hi>Rome,</hi> that neither the <hi>Cenſures</hi> nor the ſleights of the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> did worke any great effect, nor produced the commotions which they had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured; ſo that (except the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> baniſhed, the <hi>Capuchines</hi> and <hi>Theatines</hi> diſmiſſed) no other
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:17285:62"/> Order was departed, and the Diuine Seruice was celebrated after the cuſtome, yea oftentimes with more ſolemnitie, the people comming to the <hi>Churches</hi> in greater multitudes, and ſome of them now frequented the <hi>Seruice,</hi> which at other times had not beene ſo diligent. The <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> was greatly vnited in their deliberations, the Citie of <hi>Venice</hi> and the inhabitants kept themſelues in all quiet obedience, and the Cities of the <hi>Eſtate</hi> which till then had not ſent their Deputies to the new <hi>Duke</hi> for congratulation, did now performe that duty, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard or reſpect vnto the
<hi>Monitorie</hi> already pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; further declaring openly that in things temporall they would not acknowledge or obey any other power whatſoeuer. And this ſo great a tranquillitie did not onely proceed from the voluntarie obedience of the people, but alſo from the prouidence of the
<hi>Senate,</hi> and the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> which prouided for all accidents: and this great affaire was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted with ſo much prudence and dexteritie, that no bloud of any man was ſhed for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or rebellion; euery man admiring that ſo great a Body and Gouernment ſhould be kept vpright without any violence or execution. For
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:17285:63"/> touching the commandements giuen vnto the
<hi>Eecleſiastiques</hi> vnder paine of death, they were giuen in that ſort at the inſtance and requeſt of thoſe amongſt them who being voluntarily diſpoſed to execute them, deſired neuertheleſſe ſome pretext to excuſe themſelues.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> blamed the actions of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> and thoſe which ſpake leaſt to his diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, ſaid, that though his cauſe had beene neuer ſo iuſt, yet in his proceeding he had vſed too great celeritie, and too too exceſſiue confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. On the other ſide they commended the prudence of the
<hi>Venetians,</hi> who hauing receiued ſo vehement a ſhocke had yet retained their ſtate in repoſe and tranquillitie. After this came to
<hi>Rome</hi> the Father <hi>Antony Bariſon,</hi> who had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken poſte to goe tell the <hi>Pope</hi> what was ſaid at <hi>Ferrara</hi> (from whence he came,) and at other places confining vpon the <hi>State</hi> of
<hi>Venice,</hi> where the reaſons of the <hi>Republique</hi> were approued: and notwithſtanding he incited the <hi>Pope</hi> to preſerue the
<hi>Pontificall</hi> dignity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> made great complaints in the
<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtorie</hi> that the <hi>Interdict</hi> was not obſerued by the
<hi>Eccleſiastiques;</hi> and he required the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals</hi> that euery one of them would with great
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:17285:63"/> care thinke of ſome remedy, and make vnto him report a part. Neuertheleſſe the <hi>Cardinals</hi> did not beleeue that as well the <hi>Eccleſiaſtiques</hi> as the people for the moſt part were perſwaded that the <hi>Cenſures</hi> were nullities; rather they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that there was in them a diſpoſition to obſerue them, but that they expected ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to come to that effect; wherefore they eſteemed it good to giue occaſion by exciting the <hi>Religious</hi> to ſome new practiſes, either by abſtaining from Diuine Offices, or by departing out of the <hi>State.</hi> This was the reaſon, why the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> Protectors of the <hi>Regulars,</hi> together with their <hi>Superiors</hi> which were in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in other places of
<hi>Italie,</hi> did what they could with them, with menaces of Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, paines, and other euils corporall and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, as alſo with promiſes of graces, honours, dignities, not only to the Chiefe but further to each particular, if they would obſerue the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict</hi> or retire themſelues.</p>
            <p>But they dealt one way with the <hi>Monks</hi> and other
<hi>Regulars</hi> endowed, another way with the <hi>Mendicants.</hi> To theſe they ſaid, that being not able to remaine and obſerue entirely the
<hi>Interdict,</hi> they ſhould abandon their places and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:17285:64"/> depart; that it was the intention of <hi>Our Lord</hi> (ſo they called the <hi>Pope,)</hi> and if they could not depart, that they ſhould in this cauſe ſuffer mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome. But to the rented and endowed they gaue to vnderſtand that the <hi>Pope</hi> though hee would haue the <hi>Interdict</hi> obſerued, yet hee would not therefore haue the
<hi>Monaſteries</hi> aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. They ſent alſo as
<hi>Commiſſaries</hi> ſome of the <hi>Regulars</hi> of the ſame Order, ſuch as being the moſt abiect in their <hi>Congregations</hi> had offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelues to goe into dangers to acquire to themſelues ſome credit; but ſome had not the boldneſſe to enter within the <hi>State,</hi> as alſo neither by their menaces nor promiſes were any ſeduced, ſauing ſome few timorous or ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, who yeelded vpon hope of great recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences. Further, they ſuborned ſome hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites or <hi>Hermites,</hi> to enter within the Countrey to excite ſome troubles among the people, but being found vpon the confines loaden with papers and inſtructions, they were ſent backe, vpon a commandement giuen by the <hi>Senate</hi> the 24. of <hi>May</hi> to all
<hi>Gouernours</hi> to take heed that no <hi>Religious</hi> or
<hi>Prieſts</hi> from forraine parts ſhould enter with any writings, for feare and for preuenting of ſedition. All theſe deuiſes of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:17285:64"/> the ſpirituall armes, and artifices couered with pretext of <hi>Religion</hi> and piety, remained thus without effect within the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi> theſe differences were receiued very diuerſly.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Polonia, Lewis Foſcarini</hi> being come
<hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador</hi> expreſly to congratulate with that <hi>King</hi> for his mariage, the <hi>Nuntio</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> in that Kingdome, and the
<hi>Ieſuites,</hi> did what they could to make him receiue ſome affront. The <hi>Nuntio</hi> firſt deſired the <hi>King</hi> that the
<hi>Monitorie</hi> might be publiſhed, wherein he was abſolutely denied: whereupon addreſſing himſelfe vnto the <hi>Religious,</hi> he gaue order to all of them that they ſhould not admit within their <hi>Churches</hi> the
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> or any of his People. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, two of his Gentlemen being gone to heare <hi>Maſſe</hi> at the <hi>Cordeliers,</hi> they were put out of the <hi>Church;</hi> of which the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made complaint to the <hi>Marſhall</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> he and the <hi>Cardinall</hi> of <hi>Cracouia</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thoſe
<hi>Religious</hi> that the day following they ſhould ſing a ſolemne
<hi>Maſſe,</hi> to which they ſhould inuite the <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> firſt deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him pardon for the affront giuen vnto his
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:17285:65"/> Gentlemen. The <hi>Maſſe</hi> was celebrated with great concourſe of people, and diſpleaſure of the
<hi>Nuntio.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> approued of that which had beene done by his Officers, and by Decree of Parliament was publiſhed an <hi>Edict,</hi> prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all men from doing any act that might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe the
<hi>Republique;</hi> and he writ vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> complaining of the attempt of his <hi>Nuntio,</hi> where he added that his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> had great occaſion to make eſteeme of the <hi>Republique,</hi> to which all his <hi>Kingdome</hi> and he himſelfe inclined, being moued both by his owne intereſt, and by that of his <hi>Kingdome.</hi> He ſaid moreouer, that for light occaſions, and where no point of faith was que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, it was not good to make ſo great ſtirres, and exhorted his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> to be willing to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe theſe broiles; making mention againe how much the enterpriſe of the <hi>Nuntio</hi> had diſpleaſed him and all his
<hi>Councell,</hi> and ſo much the more, becauſe it was a thing vnheard in his <hi>Kingdome,</hi> that they ſhould therin publiſh Cenſures againſt any <hi>Prince</hi> whatſoeuer, ſeeing it was not done when the
<hi>Monitories</hi> were publiſhed againſt the <hi>King Henry</hi> 3 and after that in the cauſe of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara</hi> againſt the <hi>Duke Coeſar de Eſte:</hi> that it did not ſtand with reaſon to gouerne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues after
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:17285:65"/> another faſhion toward the <hi>Republike</hi> of <hi>Venice.</hi> whoſe cauſe was common with his <hi>Kingdome.</hi> All theſe particularities the <hi>King</hi> imparted to the
<hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> yea himſelfe deliuered him a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie of Lawes of his
<hi>Kingdome</hi> like to thoſe of <hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Court</hi> of the <hi>Emperour,</hi> by reaſon of the ordinary difficultie to haue Audience of his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie,</hi> the
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> treated with all the <hi>Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi> Miniſters, who ſhewed themſelues ſenſible of the wrongs of the
<hi>Republique;</hi> alledging that in all the <hi>States</hi> of
<hi>Germany</hi> were obſerued like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, and highly diſpleaſed they were for that which the <hi>Pope</hi> had done, becauſe the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> would take hence aduantage for to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie their reaſons, to the end to retaine <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall</hi> Benefices; only the <hi>Great Chancellor,</hi> and the <hi>Marſhall Prainer</hi> inclined for the <hi>Pope.</hi> In the end <hi>Francis Soranzo, Ambaſſador,</hi> had Audience of the <hi>Emperour,</hi> who thanked him for commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating theſe matters with him, and maruelled that the <hi>Nuntio</hi> had neuer ſpoken vnto him thereof; and exhorted him to finde ſome tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of compoſition. But <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> day being come, vpon which the
<hi>Ieſuites</hi> are wont to make a very ſolemne Proceſſion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:17285:66"/> aſſiſt al the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of
<hi>Princes;</hi> the Fathers did what they could with the
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique,</hi> that he would be abſent, who bitterly reprehending them reſolued to be there, as he was, the
<hi>Nuntio</hi> in the meane while faining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be indiſpoſed to auoid it. But two other being to be made the daies following, the
<hi>Nuntio</hi> conſidered what preiudice it would be to him, if they were done as the firſt. And therefore he employed the <hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> of
<hi>Tuſcany</hi> to deale with him of <hi>Venice,</hi> that he ſhould not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, threatning otherwiſe he would cauſe the <hi>Church</hi> doores to be ſhut vp, and hinder the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, in as much as he was not to he admitted into the <hi>Church,</hi> being a perſon Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. Wherefore he might doe well to preuent the ſcandall that would enſue, ſince all the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> would vnite themſelues to him, and on the other ſide all <hi>Catholiques</hi> ſeparate from him. Hereupon the
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> referred himſelfe to be directed by the
<hi>Emperour;</hi> but his <hi>Maiesty</hi> not willing to meddle in theſe
<hi>Ecclefiaſticall</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> reſolued to take Phyſicke and keepe in, fearing to receiue ſome affront by the meanes of the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> and of the <hi>Nuntio,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herein aided by the <hi>Marſhall Prainer,</hi> ill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:17285:66"/> to the <hi>Republique,</hi> to whom no other
<hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter</hi> did oppoſe himſelfe: vpon hope to haue 100000. crowns fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Pope</hi> for the war againſt the <hi>Turkes.</hi> But afterwards, the <hi>Pope</hi> hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to giue that ſuccour, for want wherof they were conſtrained to make peace with the Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of
<hi>Hungary,</hi> and to yeeld vnto them the places which they had ſeiſed, with the exerciſe of their Religion; and the <hi>Marſhall Prainer</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, as alſo the <hi>Nuntio</hi> a little ſoftened, after that he ſaw the <hi>Nuntio's</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> had beene made <hi>Cardinals,</hi> without any recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of himſelfe, things there receiued ſome change, and the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> was freely euery where admitted. And there is no doubt, that if he had ſhewed himſelfe firme from the beginning, he had ſurmounted all difficulty, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a Month after complaining in the name of the <hi>Republique</hi> to the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto him that beſides the iniurie done to Him, his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> had therein beene wronged, in that the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould intrude himſelfe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand (within his

But vpon notice that the
<hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict</hi> was publiſhed, the <hi>King</hi> ſaw that things had paſſed further than he was willing, and was grieued that he had no ſooner interpoſed. The <hi>Nuntio</hi> in the meane while made inſtance that the
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> might be declared Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate in the Pulpits, ſaying that if the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> preſented himſelfe in the Chappell of the <hi>King,</hi> hee would command the
<hi>Kings</hi> Chaplaines to ceaſe the Diuine Offices, and if he were not obeyed, that he would goe out. In this <hi>Court</hi> were rendered many euill offices to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique,</hi> eſpecially by them of <hi>Genoa,</hi> out of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, becauſe their <hi>Republique</hi> had yeelded to the

               <hi>Popes</hi> will, and that of
<hi>Venice</hi> preſerued their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie. They turned all to their aduantage, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending <hi>Genoa</hi> for Deuotion and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and aſcribing to obſtinacie and want of Religion, that which had beene iuſtly done at <hi>Venice,</hi> for the conſeruation of their owne Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. But aboue all that ſhewed themſelues ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the principall was the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> of <hi>Monte-pulcian, Ambaſſador</hi> of the great <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> who not only abſtained from viſiting the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> but alſo ſought all occaſions to detract from the actions of the <hi>Republique;</hi> as alſo <hi>Aſdruball de Montaigu,</hi> Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for the ſame

For theſe reaſons, at <hi>Madrid</hi> in the Houſe and preſence of the <hi>Cardinall</hi> of <hi>Toledo,</hi> was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled a Congregation of twelue <hi>Diuines,</hi> where it was conſulted whether they ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of
<hi>Venice</hi> to Diuine Offices, not only the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> but the
<hi>Ieſuites</hi> alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king great inſtance that he might be excluded: but in the <hi>Congregation</hi> there being none which opined againſt the
<hi>Republique</hi> but only the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> it was in the end concluded that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould be altered. And the <hi>King,</hi> that he
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:17285:69"/> might not declare himſelfe either by admitting or excluding him in his <hi>Chappell,</hi> remained many daies without vſing it. And the newes being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued in this <hi>Court,</hi> that the <hi>Ambaſſador Soranzo</hi> had beene excluded at <hi>Prage</hi> from the Proceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they did not make any great accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of what had paſſed in the <hi>Court</hi> of the <hi>Emperour</hi> touching this buſineſſe, and the <hi>Nuntio</hi> who in his inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces propoſed him for example, was anſwered, that that <hi>Kingdome</hi> was not gouerned after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of others.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> at <hi>Venice</hi> being not accuſtomed to be preſent in the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> Ceremonies with the <hi>Duke,</hi> becauſe of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of Prioritie betweene him and the other of <hi>France,</hi> had no occaſion herein to ſhew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of his <hi>Maſter:</hi> but in all other things he comported himſelfe after the ſame faſhion as before, treating after the accuſtomed manner, ſo that no man ſaw any difference.</p>
            <p>And though in theſe affaires and others, the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>Spaine</hi> and his <hi>Miniſters</hi> ſhewed much reſpect towards the <hi>Republique,</hi> yet they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to make declaration for the

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:17285:70" rendition="simple:additions"/> they made anſwer conformably to his deſire, ſo as ſhall be ſaid hereafter.</p>
            <p>In <hi>France,</hi> when vpon the thirtieth of <hi>Ianua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Peter Prinli Ambaſſador</hi> of the <hi>Repub.</hi> gaue aduiſe vnto the
<hi>King</hi> of all that had paſſed, his <hi>Maiestie</hi> teſtified a very great deſire that there might bee found ſome meanes of agreement which might be without preiudice, and that a Treatie to this purpoſe might be furthered: gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing example in himſelfe, who had eluded the great inſtances which had beene made vnto him for the receiuing of the <hi>Trent Councell,</hi> ſo far as offer was made him to reſtraine it, where it ſhould be contrary to the liberties of the <hi>French Church.</hi> And albeit he knew well at what they aimed, notwithſtanding that he made his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the time, diſſembling ſomethings which he ſaw well. He enquired further of the
<hi>Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador</hi> how theſe encounters might be auoided, without wrong to the order in Gouernment v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the <hi>Republique,</hi> diſcouering herein a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be ſollicited to be a <hi>Mediatour</hi> in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire. He commanded alſo ſpeedily <hi>Alincourt</hi> his
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> that he ſhould render all kinde of good Offices for the <hi>Republique,</hi> with his <hi>Holineſſe. Freſne</hi> likewiſe <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of the

            <p>Now preſently after the newes of the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the

On the contrary, as ſoone as the <hi>King</hi> knew of the Publication of the

He further writ thereof particular Letters to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, vnto the two brethren of the <hi>Pope,</hi> to the <hi>Cardinall Borgheſe,</hi> and to the
<hi>French Cardinals:</hi> and although the Poſt did not arriue till after the daies prefixed by the <hi>Monitory, Alincourt</hi> the
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> did not therefore omit to deliuer the Letters, and to treat thereof with his <hi>Holineſſe;</hi> who excuſed himſelfe, for as much as the Terme was expired, which took from him the meanes of prolonging it, and ſo of giuing ſatisfaction vnto the
<hi>King.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended that his mediation had beene ſo little eſteemed: neuertheleſſe he reſolued to purſue it,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:17285:71"/> and writ to his <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> that he ſhould not neglect to treat with the <hi>Pope</hi> for to giue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſome other meanes of accord.</p>
            <p>In <hi>England,</hi> the opinion which that <hi>King</hi> hath of the <hi>Popes</hi> authoritie being well knowne to all the world, any one may iudge how he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the newes of theſe actions of the <hi>Pope.</hi> Nor ſhall it be neceſſary to relate any thing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but only the anſwer which the <hi>King</hi> gaue to <hi>Iuſtiniano, Ambaſſador</hi> for the
<hi>Republique,</hi> then, when he informed him of all that had paſſed in
<hi>Senate;</hi> which was very notable. The <hi>King</hi> then hauing heard the relation of the <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had ſhewed how well he accepted that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and had commended the Lawes of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique,</hi> ſaid, that he longed to ſee the whole <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God</hi> reformed; and that to this end he deſired much a Free <hi>Councel</hi> to determine ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Controuerſies, which haue no other cauſe but the Spirituall Vſurpations of the <hi>Roman Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> in which deſire he thought the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and other <hi>Princes</hi> would ioine with him: that perhaps <hi>God</hi> meant to produce this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe out of theſe troubles of the <hi>Republique;</hi> that he had ſpoken thereof to <hi>Pope Clement,</hi> then when hee was moued by him (when firſt hee

<hi>England)</hi> to vnite him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> but he would not heare any thing of a <hi>Councell;</hi> that this <hi>Vnion</hi> was much to be deſired, but clearely there was no other meane to effect it, then by a free <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> added moreouer that the ruine of the <hi>Church</hi> proceeded from this, that the <hi>Popes</hi> eſteemed themſelues as <hi>Gods,</hi> and further were ſo corrupted by flattery, that it was no maruell if they could not giue care to any reaſon, and if they proceeded with preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation.</p>

            <p>At <hi>Turin,</hi> when the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Sauoy</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by <hi>Peter Contarini, Ambaſſador</hi> of the
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique,</hi> how the <hi>Monitorie</hi> had beene affixed at

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:17285:72"/> well vnderſtood the reaſons of the
<hi>Republique,</hi> and that it was the common cauſe of all
<hi>Princes,</hi> ſo as he could not make any demonſtration in fauour of the <hi>Pope,</hi> although the <hi>Nuntio</hi> made great inſtance to that purpoſe. Yet not willing openly to offend his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> he abſtained from the <hi>Chappell,</hi> to take away all occaſion of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell. Notwithſtanding the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> which he had at
<hi>Venice</hi> did not gouerne himſelfe with the ſame moderation: but on the contrary, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired himſelfe from the <hi>Court,</hi> auoiding the
<hi>Dukes</hi> preſence, though he was often inuited: and in the
<hi>Citie,</hi> in the part where hee had his lodging, he did many euill offices towards the <hi>Eccleſiaſtiques,</hi> againſt the <hi>Repub</hi> and in fauour of the <hi>Pope;</hi> which ſerued more to ſhew his crooked ſpirit and paſſion, then to doe any hurt or damage to the <hi>State.</hi> And the <hi>Duke</hi> himſelfe, although he had alwaies the ſame opinion of the <hi>Popes</hi> Cenſures, did not afterward treat in the like faſhion with the <hi>Ambaſſador.</hi> For the <hi>Republique</hi> hauing written to his children, with the title of <hi>Excellencie</hi> (ſo as they had accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) he in diſdaine hereof, made a <hi>Chappell</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out admitting thereunto the <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> and gaue him notice that it was becauſe the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:17285:73"/> had not vſed the ſtile of

            <p>At <hi>Florence,</hi> the great <hi>Duke</hi> did not make any nouelty with <hi>Robert Lio</hi> Secretary of the <hi>Republique,</hi> but treated with him in all reſpects as formerly he was wont. But <hi>Antony Grimani Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Torcelli,</hi> the <hi>Popes Nuntio</hi> in that place, altho a <hi>Venetian</hi> Gentleman himſelfe, refuſed to receiue the
<hi>Secretary</hi> into his Houſe; giuing him to vnderſtand that he would not be viſited by Him, vntill he had order from <hi>Rome</hi> what he ſhould do. Yet a few daies after hauing changed his minde (no man knowes for what reaſon) without expecting any other order from <hi>Rome,</hi> he returned to treat with him as before.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Naples,</hi> the <hi>Count de Beneuento, Viceroy,</hi> vpon that which was repreſented vnto him by <hi>Auſtine Dolce</hi> Reſident in that <hi>Court</hi> for the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique,</hi> blamed the raſh proceedings of the <hi>Pope,</hi> approued the reaſons of the <hi>Republique,</hi> and treated alwaies with the Reſident as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, as did in like manner

            </p>
            <p>The like was alſo obſerued at <hi>Milan</hi> by the <hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> Gouernour of that <hi>Eſtate,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Antony Paulucci</hi> Reſident with him for

            <p>The <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Modena</hi> alſo teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied what eſteeme they made of the <hi>Repub.</hi> and what iudgement they had of the <hi>Popes</hi> actions, by meanes of their Reſidents at
<hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (to reſume our diſcourſe) the <hi>Princes</hi> of
<hi>Italie</hi> together with the <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> as well at <hi>Rome</hi> as at <hi>Venice,</hi> after that they knew that the
<hi>Pope</hi> (ſeeing his <hi>Monitorie</hi> lightly eſteemed) was much perplexed, as if he had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly repented him of the fact, had ſome hope that the affaire might be accommodated, and each of them deſired to be a
<hi>Mediator</hi> in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; and during three <hi>Moneths</hi> after the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication, they offered themſelues not without enuy one of another.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Mantua,</hi> (who had notice from his
<hi>Agent</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> that he had found the <hi>Pope</hi> more tractable, as if he meant to doe more for his ſake then for all the reſt, and willingly would treat with him,) made offer to goe both to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> and to <hi>Rome</hi> vpon this employment. But the <hi>Senate</hi> anſwered him that they had vſed all reaſons and dexteritie poſſible to ſtay the <hi>Pope</hi> that he might not precipitate, but poſſibly they
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:17285:74"/> could not hinder him from doing that to which his will paſſionately carried him. And now that they had ſuſtained ſuch irreparable wrong, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be done, vnleſſe firſt the
<hi>Pope</hi> would retract his Cenſures, and reduce things to their firſt eſtate; that neuertheleſſe there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the <hi>Republique</hi> a diſpoſition to ſhew themſelues obedient to the <hi>See Apoſtolique</hi> in all things wherein their Liberty ſhould not be violated, nor their Gouernment altered.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Guicciardin, Ambaſſador</hi> of the great
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> being come to doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements vnto the
<hi>Duke</hi> becauſe of his election and ſtill remaining at
<hi>Venice,</hi> gaue them notice of the good office which the great
<hi>Duke</hi> had performed for the <hi>Republique</hi> with his
<hi>Holineſſe,</hi> by the meanes of the Biſhop of <hi>Soana,</hi> and what had beene treated hereupon; that his <hi>Highneſſe</hi> offered to paſſe yet further, and euen to goe to <hi>Rome</hi> in perſon. Anſwer was made him, with hearty thankfulneſſe and acknowledgment of his good will; adding withall that theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles were not raiſed by the
<hi>Republique,</hi> but by the <hi>Popes</hi> raſhneſſe, who without any reaſon had offended them ſo ſenſibly. And therefore things ſtanding in ſuch termes, they could not
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:17285:74"/> but thinke of defending themſelues, yet alwaies purpoſing to continue in the <hi>Catholique</hi> religion. After, the great <hi>Duke</hi> treated with <hi>Robert Lio Secretarie</hi> and
<hi>Agent</hi> of the <hi>Republique</hi> with him, to whom he ſaid; That he could not deny but the <hi>Pope</hi> had too much precipitated this affaire, that he ought not in ſuch faſhion to haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with a
<hi>Prince,</hi> no not in caſe of hereſie; but that ſince he was better aduiſed, and began to heare, and therefore that it was time to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the treaty; that the anſwer which had beene ſent him from <hi>Venice</hi> was full of affection, but conciſe and ſhort; that it was needfull to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to particulars and to giue ſome ſatisfaction vnto the <hi>Pope;</hi> that they might ſerue the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like by ſome other way which might be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the
<hi>Pope;</hi> that it was vnprofitable to diſpute of words when men deſire to compaſſe their intentions; that betweene the <hi>Pope</hi> and the
<hi>Repub.</hi> things were not equall, and that they had to treat with the
<hi>Vicar</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> that there might be deuiſed ſome temperament with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration vpon the publique Lawes ſo as they had accuſtomed to doe, at leaſt that preſeruing their Ordinances they might giue the ordinary ſatisfaction of words.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:17285:75"/> The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Sauoy</hi> ſaid alſo to the <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor Contarini</hi> that hee had employed himſelfe with the <hi>Pope,</hi> to whom he had freely declared that the coniuncture of things ſeem'd to require him to admit of ſome temper, ſince it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that all <hi>Princes</hi> would not be on his ſide. And that the <hi>Republique</hi> ought to haue the ſame conſideration, howſoeuer in all reaſon they had the right: that he himſelfe had continuall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes with the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> but that he tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poriſed in putting them off from one day to another. Wherefore that it was expedient to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie theſe differences, to which end he offred his labour and diligence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Innigo de Cardenas, Ambaſſador</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> exhorted alſo greatly the <hi>Republique</hi> to peace, aſſuring them that his <hi>King</hi> had the ſame thoughts for the tranquillitie of
<hi>Italie;</hi> and therefore praied the <hi>Repub.</hi> to open a way to ſome temperament, adioyning that this office was not done onely towards them, but it had beene alſo done effectually at <hi>Rome</hi> on the part of the
<hi>King</hi> his Maſter.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Monſieur de Freſne, Ambaſſador</hi> of the moſt
<hi>Chriſtian King</hi> trauelled with much more efficacie and care then all the reſt. For the terme
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:17285:75"/> of the <hi>Monitorie</hi> being not yet expired, he gaue aduice vnto the <hi>Senate</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent himſelfe, and was greatly moued with that which had paſſed. That with any little ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or euen appearance of ſatisfaction, hee would be contented; that ſo he was aduertiſed by <hi>Alincourt, Ambaſſador</hi> for the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> Afterwards he told them how the ſaid <hi>Alin court</hi> and the <hi>French Cardinals</hi> had made an in ſtant remonſtrance to his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> making it plaine vnto him that the preſent opportunities (when the <hi>See Apoſtolique</hi> was not without af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires in <hi>Hungarie,)</hi> could not permit that hee ſhould depriue himſelfe of his right hand which was the
<hi>Repub.</hi> And vpon the requeſt which they made vnto him in the end of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, to ſuſpend the <hi>Monitorie,</hi> hauing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded two daies to thinke vpon it, how hee anſwered that he had conferred thereof with diuers <hi>Cardinals,</hi> who ioyntly concluded that he could not doe it with honour, by reaſon of the Proteſtation of the <hi>Repub.</hi> full of iniurious words (ſo he ſaid) againſt his Perſon. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it was told them by the <hi>Card. Borgheſe,</hi> that if the <hi>Repub.</hi> would ſhew any dutie, reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Law of the <hi>Emphyteuſes,</hi> and rendring
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:17285:76"/> the Priſoners into the hands of the
<hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> might ſuſpend the <hi>Monitorie</hi> for ſome daies, to the end to giue ouerture to ſome treaty. To this the ſaid
<hi>Freſne</hi> adioyned, that they ſhould take in good part the interpoſition of the <hi>King,</hi> who hauing his Kingdome peaceable, aſſured, and without any intereſts, whatſoeuer he did was for the common good of others; that if he could hope by his meanes to accord theſe differences, he would ſend for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the greateſt <hi>Prince</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> yea he would come in perſon himſelfe: that the
<hi>Pope</hi> was not another <hi>Iulius</hi> 2. who carried fire in his hands; that the <hi>Republique</hi> might be confident in the <hi>King,</hi> and if they ſhould open his heart they ſhould finde it wholly <hi>Venetian. Freſne</hi> yet a third time returned, and ſaid, that by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
<hi>Currier</hi> he had beene aduertiſed that the <hi>Marquis de Villena</hi> had prayed the <hi>Pope</hi> not to proceed further for ſome few daies; becauſe there were to come ſome commandements fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Spaine,</hi> with ſuch effectuall offices towards the <hi>Repub.</hi> that They ſhould be neceſſitated to giue all ſatisfaction: Wherefore he praied his
<hi>Holineſſe</hi> not to yeeld to the offers or offices of
<hi>France;</hi> and that the <hi>Pope</hi> was therewith very
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:17285:76"/> well content, ſo as he ſaid that if he could hope to be aided, he had a purpoſe to cite the <hi>Duke</hi> into the
<hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and to accuſe him of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie. Therefore
<hi>Freſne</hi> adioyned, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the <hi>Republique</hi> to vſe diligence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue themſelues, that they might not doe by force and with preiudice what they might doe voluntarily and with honour. And that they would not doe for any other, what they refuſed to doe for the <hi>King</hi> their Friend and Confident.</p>
            <p>To all theſe propoſitions, the <hi>Senate</hi> anſwer red at once. Firſt, they thanked the <hi>King</hi> for his good offices, maruelling that the <hi>Pope</hi> had not beene any more affected with them; thence exaggerating ſo much more his ſtiffeneſſe, and thereby that it might be concluded, there was ſmall hope to reduce him to any ſound coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. Then they added, that if the <hi>Pope</hi> would not repaire their iniuries by reuoking his <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> there could be no ouerture to a treaty; that the <hi>Senate</hi> had already (by extraordinary <hi>Ambaſs.)</hi> made appeare, with many demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, all ſorts of reſpect; that now things were at that paſſe, that propoſals were not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ſeeing the
<hi>Pope</hi> had gone ſo far as to wrong them; that the <hi>Republique</hi> had not hurt
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:17285:77"/> any perſon in their Proteſtation, but onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended themſelues, and to make it appeare to all the world that they would continue <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique;</hi> that when the Cenſures ſhould be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, the <hi>Senate</hi> would treat vpon that which the <hi>King</hi> propounded, prouided that it might not be againſt the Liberty of the <hi>Republique,</hi> nor for to confound their Gouernment; that touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things treated by the
<hi>Ambaſs.</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> with the <hi>Pope,</hi> it was not needfull to ſay any other thing but that in all caſes the
<hi>Republique</hi> would defend their Libertie, without doing any thing vnworthy of Them; that therein they deſired to haue the moſt
<hi>Chriſtian Kings</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, at whoſe requeſt they would doe any thing they could, and that they would not doe for any other what they would not for him; that the iniuries offered to the perſon of the <hi>Duke</hi> did not touch ſo much his particular as all the <hi>Repub.</hi> which would auenge themſelues for ſo great and extraordinarie an iniuſtice, which was nothing but a pure malice for to diuide the concord and good intelligence which was in the <hi>Senate</hi> and in all the <hi>Repub.</hi> and that it would be a meanes to cut off and hinder all ſorts of treaties. <hi>Freſne</hi> much praiſed
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:17285:77"/> this anſwer, notwithſtanding he replied; that the <hi>Pope</hi> with teares had ſaid to <hi>Monſieur d' Alin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> that he would not alter the Rights of the <hi>Republique,</hi> but onely conſerue the authoritie and dignitie of the <hi>See Apoſtolique:</hi> that if the <hi>Senate</hi> would ſuſpend their Lawes hee would ſuſpend his <hi>Cenſures,</hi> promiſing he would be contented that things ſhould ſtand in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer eſtate, and that the Lawes ſhould be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued after that He had confirmed them. And continuing his ſpeech, he ſaid, that it ſhould be very good to make ouerture to a treaty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deferring, for delaies would but euery day multiply difficulties: that the <hi>K.</hi> himſelf had bin calumniated at
<hi>Rome,</hi> as if he had procured the abaſement of the Authority of the
<hi>Holy See</hi> that the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Maſter</hi> deſired that whetherſoeuer had firſt offended ſhould be the firſt to repaire the offence: but the <hi>Pope</hi> perſiſting, there might be found a temperament to ſuſpend the Lawes and the <hi>Monitorie</hi> both at the ſame time: that the <hi>King</hi> deſired this accord for the affection which he had to the <hi>Republique;</hi> and further, becauſe theſe differences would hinder the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of Hereſies, which ought to be equally agreeable both to the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Repub.</hi>

<hi>Republique.</hi>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:17285:82" rendition="simple:additions"/> That with the <hi>Princes</hi> of
<hi>Italy</hi> they had ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured to effect that the <hi>Republique</hi> ſhould not be permitted to make any leuy of men within their
<hi>Eſtates;</hi> &amp; when this deuice ſucceeded not, they went in all places deteſting the name of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> and finally menacing them that ſhould go to warre in their defence; the ſeditions are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſſe which they haue excited within the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of the <hi>State</hi> by their Letters, inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſpeeches with the Subiects of the
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique,</hi> who went for their affaires vnto the Cities where theſe men were, &amp; with their deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ones which they cauſed to come vpon the confines of the <hi>State.</hi> It was further iuſtified, that a good part of the vexations done by the <hi>Pope</hi> vnto the <hi>Republique,</hi> vpon theſe occaſions had proceeded from their inſtigations, and from the hopes that they had giuen him, that they had a faction, and could put diuiſion in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</hi> Now for matters paſſed formerly, it was alſo verified, that when the <hi>Republique</hi> after the death of <hi>Henry</hi>
3. gaue the title of moſt <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an King</hi> vnto <hi>Henry</hi> 4. theſe men had vaunted at <hi>Rome</hi> that they had put ſcruples in the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of many <hi>Senators,</hi> who had repented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of that they had done, promiſing to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:17285:83"/> them in caſe that they would promiſe to retract; that therefore it was facile at the leaſt inſtance of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> to change the whole face of this affaire, which was the cauſe that his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> preſſed them, who being not ſatisfied, hence followed ſo many diſcontentments; that on diuers occaſions they had ſhewed themſelues the fauourers of great <hi>Princes,</hi> &amp; by that meanes had mingled themſelues in the affaires of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment; that they diſpended yearely aboue an hundred crownes in the portage of Letters, whereby appeared the multitude of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and the correſpondencies which they had in all parts. Further, it was proued againſt them that they had great deſignes vpon the goods and faculties of their Penitents, and of Women eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, to the great preiudice of Families. Alſo their Doctrine was conſidered in matters Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique; that they praiſed <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and blamed an <hi>Ariſtocratie,</hi> with certaine Maximes very contrary to the Gouernment and Inſtitution of the <hi>Republique:</hi> adde hereunto that the
<hi>Ieſuites</hi> had beene the Authors and Inſtruments of all Vproares, Seditions, Confuſions, and Ruines happening within our Times in all
<hi>Kingdomes</hi> and <hi>States</hi> in the world. Wherfore hauing found
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:17285:83" rendition="simple:additions"/> their faults in ſo great number, and they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſome particulars of them, but in the corps of their Societie; all was propoſed in <hi>Senate,</hi> who deliberated hereupon the fourteenth of <hi>Iune,</hi> and made the Decree which followeth; That the Congregation of <hi>Ieſuites</hi> hauing beene receiued at <hi>Venice</hi> from their firſt beginning, and there euer ſince fauoured, they on the contrary returning nothing but ingratitude towards the <hi>Republique,</hi> and ſhewing themſelues ſtill incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to doe all ſorts of euill Offices to that <hi>State:</hi> in which diſpoſition they yet continued by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable enterpriſes, and inſolent calumnies, ſeeking all occaſions to offend them: For theſe cauſes, they ſhould neuer be admitted or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in any place of the <hi>State,</hi> nor this Decree reuoked, vnleſſe the whole Proceſſe againſt them were firſt read in full <hi>Senate,</hi> (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of no leſſe than 180.
<hi>Senators,)</hi> whereof fiue parts (the whole being compoſed of ſix) ſhould giue ſuffrage for their reuocation. And this may be one certain argument of their enormous and euident crimes, that there was not any one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (of ſo great a number) who ſpake anything in fauour of them: and in the Scrutiny made by ſecret voices, all were found vnanimous to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:17285:84"/> decree their perpetuall baniſhment; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that ſome of this number had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſed them as their <hi>Confeſſors,</hi> who had much fauoured them on many other occaſions.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Pope</hi> fore-ſeeing the difficulties to come to this accord ſo much deſired, with the honour which he expected; and likewiſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that all the ſhifts and artifices as well of the
<hi>Ieſuites</hi> as of other <hi>Eccleſiastiques,</hi> could not cauſe any trouble in the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Republique,</hi> (which he thought might be greatly profitable to induce the <hi>Senate</hi> to yeeld to his will) all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes to this effect reſting vaine and without fruit, as alſo being not able by ſo many deuices and trickes to draw to himſelfe any other than ſome ſimple perſons, aduiſed himſelfe of a moſt ſubtill inuention: Which was, that on the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>Iune</hi> he publiſhed a
<hi>Iubilee,</hi> whereby he inuited all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to pray
<hi>God</hi> with him for the neceſſities of the <hi>Church;</hi> and to this end granted Indulgences, Abſolutions, and Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to all, excepting them that were found in Cities or places <hi>Interdicted,</hi> whom hee exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from theſe fauours, not comprehending them ſo much as in their number, whoſe prayers he implored. In <hi>Italy</hi> no Spirituall thing is more
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:17285:84"/> wiſhed or expected by the people, and when it is granted, nothing receiued with more deuout affection than a
<hi>Iubilee.</hi> Whereupon at <hi>Rome</hi> they beleeued that the people within the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> ſeeing themſelues depriued of ſuch Graces giuen to all the faithfull, would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be moued with ſedition to ſeeke their part in them. But the euill deſigne which the
<hi>Ieſuites</hi> did hope would ſucceed by their Sermons in the neighbouring places, where they had publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declamed againſt the Honour of the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> being fruſtrate; they aduiſed hereupon to put in worke their laſt artifice to raiſe vp com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, by writing to their Adherents, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Pope</hi> had excluded from the
<hi>Iubilee</hi> in generall all the Subiects of the <hi>State</hi> of
<hi>Venice,</hi> yet they had power from his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> to grant it to ſuch perſons as would obſerue the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by them propounded, among which theſe were ſome, not to goe to <hi>Maſſe,</hi> not to approue the publique reaſons and actions, and others more important.</p>
            <p>The end of this <hi>Inbilee</hi> was very well knowne in
<hi>Spaine,</hi> for although they haue a very great deuotion towards the Indulgences which come from <hi>Rome,</hi> and principally in the
<hi>Iubilees,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:17285:85"/> they remained in ſuſpence; and though the
<hi>Nuntio</hi> were very inſtant to cauſe it to be publiſhed, yet three
<hi>Moneths</hi> paſſed before they gaue their conſent.</p>
            <p>In this ſame time wherein at <hi>Rome</hi> they were thus buſied in Ceremonies, a certaine Writing was affixed at <hi>Vicenza,</hi> and many other places, whereby the <hi>Republique</hi> was exhorted to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw it ſelfe from the obedience of the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> and hereupon it touched many points of Religion, calling the <hi>Pope Antichriſt:</hi> Which being knowne at <hi>Venice,</hi> the <hi>Senate</hi> was there with greatly troubled, their reſolution being to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue alwayes moſt conſtant to conſerue their Religion inuiolable. They conſidered that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſuch actions might be done by ſtealth, and ſome one man, neuertheleſſe if prouiſion were not made ſtrictly to deterre any more to imitate the like, there might follow very pernicious conſequences. Whereupon they cauſed to bee publiſhed a very rigorous <hi>Ban,</hi> promiſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence to him that could diſcouer the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, giuing charge to the Gouernours to make an exact ſearch after him. But with all the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence which they could vſe nothing could be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, ſaue only ſome obſcure co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iectures that this
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:17285:85"/> was an Artifice of the
<hi>Ecclefiaſtiques</hi> themſelues, whether to ſhew the danger wherein they were, and thereby to incite the <hi>State</hi> to ſome ſpeedie accord with the <hi>Pope,</hi> or for to verifie the calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which the
<hi>Ieſuiticall</hi> Fathers diſperſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the
<hi>Republique.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame time when the <hi>Pope</hi> publiſhed this
<hi>Iubilee,</hi> he wrought in ſuch ſort with the <hi>Marquis de Villena,</hi> that he diſpatched a <hi>Currier</hi> into <hi>Spaine,</hi> to giue aduiſe vnto his <hi>King,</hi> that his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> would caſt himſelfe intirely vnder his Protection; and that for this reaſon he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not onely his fauour, but ſome ſuccour of men. But the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> anſwered his <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador,</hi> that he ought to repreſſe theſe thoughts, in as much as the troubles of
<hi>Italy</hi> would not be aduantageous either to the <hi>See Apoſtolique,</hi> or the Crowne of <hi>Spaine.</hi> And although this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer afflicted the <hi>Pope</hi> beyond meaſure, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe to trie all meanes, he himſelfe diſpatched a Poſt with a <hi>Breue</hi> to that <hi>King,</hi> and a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting containing his Reaſons: which he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a Letter addreſſed to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lerm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Breue</hi> was written firſt in <hi>Latine,</hi> but afterwards in the vulgar <hi>Italian,</hi> for to giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him the title of
<hi>Excellence,</hi> a thing which the <hi>Popes</hi> haue not vſed. Notwithſtanding all this, the <hi>Pope,</hi> diſtruſting to obtaine from
<hi>Spaine</hi> that which he deſired, hearkned vnto the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of peace propoſed. And it is certaine, that the offices done by the <hi>Cardinals</hi> and <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and eſpecially thoſe of the
<hi>Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> had ſuch effect, that being ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the remorſe which the <hi>Pope</hi> felt in his conſcience, they reduced him to ſuch a point that he was neere perſwaded to condeſcent to a ſuſpenſion of the <hi>Cenſures,</hi> to open a way to ſome farther treaty; and he came ſo far as to collect hereupon the ſuffrages and opinions of the <hi>Cardinals.</hi> But whileſt he was conſidering of their aduice, in the beginning of <hi>Iuly,</hi> at the ſame time when <hi>Freſne</hi> made his laſt inſtance whereof we haue ſpoken, and when the <hi>Ban</hi> againſt the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> and the publication of a <hi>Iubilee</hi> interrupted the treaty, came the anſwer of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> to the <hi>Letters</hi> of his

            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Letter</hi> was read by the <hi>Pope</hi> with great ioy, which he teſtified not onely by words, but by his Letters full of affection to that <hi>King,</hi> and to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lerma,</hi> which he ſent by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe <hi>Currier.</hi> There were who beleeued that theſe Letters, which were ſaid to come from <hi>Spaine,</hi> had beene written in <hi>Italy:</hi> and they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for a good coniecture, that the
<hi>King</hi> therein wrote that he had ſignified his pleaſure to the
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> who was with him, although he had not ſpoken one word to him thereof before he had receiued the anſwer of the
<hi>Pope.</hi> But it is true that the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lerma</hi> for the honour which his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> had done him, and in regard of his humble praiers in his
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:17285:87"/> 
               <hi>Letters,</hi> was willing on his ſide to correſpond, which was to him very eaſie: For the <hi>Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors</hi> of
<hi>Eſtate,</hi> by reaſon of the tranſlation of the <hi>Court,</hi> hauing permiſſion to abſent themſelues for three Moneths, none of them were at the <hi>Court,</hi> ſaue the <hi>Duke de Chinçon,</hi> who (as brother in law to the <hi>Marquis de Villena)</hi> had the ſame deſignes. It was further ſaid by ſome Miniſters of that <hi>King</hi> in
<hi>Italy,</hi> that he ſuffered himſelfe to be perſwaded to write that Letter, vpon hope to pacifie things more eaſily, inaſmuch as ſome
<hi>Venetian Prelates</hi> had aſſured, that when the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>Spaine</hi> ſhould declare himſelfe openly for the <hi>Pope,</hi> the
<hi>Senate</hi> would yeeld, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humble themſelues: which being writ from <hi>Rome</hi> into <hi>Spaine,</hi> did render the demand of his
<hi>Holineſſe</hi> more eaſie with the <hi>King</hi> and the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lerma,</hi> both which inclined to the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the peace.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>Spaine</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Miniſters in <hi>Italy,</hi> pretended by this <hi>Letter</hi> &amp; other offices, to haue put the <hi>See Apoſtolique</hi> in great reputation: ſo that <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> ſaid vnto the <hi>Pope;</hi> That his <hi>King</hi> would make him obtaine with a few words that which others could not doe with many; and that hee
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:17285:87"/> would bring the <hi>Venetians</hi> proſtrate at the feet of his <hi>Holineſſe.</hi> Hereby it ſeemed vnto the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> that they had well merited of the <hi>Holy See,</hi> and that they might expect requitall from the <hi>Pope,</hi> at their need. And therefore purpoſing hereby to reape no leſſe profit and reputation than the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelfe, they required of him three things: The firſt that he would make at <hi>Rome</hi> a publique Feſtiuall, with bonefires and other ſignes of ioy and gratulation. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that the <hi>Letter</hi> might be read in <hi>Conſiſtory</hi> and conſerued within the
<hi>Archiues.</hi> The third, that he would totally breake off the treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and not ſpeake any more of this affaire with the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King.</hi> Which demands being publiſhed in <hi>Court,</hi> and from thence thorowout the
<hi>Citie,</hi> moued <hi>Alincourt</hi> to goe to the Audience, and to giue the <hi>Pope</hi> to vnderſtand what rumors were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered of the Triumphs which were made by occaſion of this <hi>Letter,</hi> and of the things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed and demanded by the <hi>Ambaſs.</hi> of <hi>Spaine.</hi> To which he added, that all was nothing but vaine oſtentation, to interrupt the treaty of Peace, and to hold in diſcord two of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt <hi>Princes</hi> in
<hi>Italy,</hi> who remaining vnited
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:17285:88"/> might be a counterpoiſe ſufficient to hinder the deſignes of theſe men: that the termes which they vſed were too too arrogant, euen in the mouth of a <hi>Monarch</hi> of all the world: that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> knew well enough themſelues and their feebleneſſe, which they could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe maintaine: that in
<hi>Italy</hi> they beleeued they might command all, and be the ſole arbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators of all things; neuertheleſſe if they would be ſtirring, others would not onely looke on with the armes acroſſe, and let them doe what they liſt. The <hi>Pope</hi> confeſſed that the demands of the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> were true, but that they could not pleaſe him, and that Hee could doe nothing therein: that he would not ceaſe for all that to continue the Treaty already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun: True it is, that he held himſelfe obliged to the two <hi>Crownes</hi> for the piety of the two <hi>Kings,</hi> from whom hee equally hoped for all protection: That he had already taken the voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and that euery of them counſelled him not to paſſe further on the points propoſed for accord, if the
<hi>Venetians</hi> did not ſhew reſpect. Notwithſtanding, the partizans of <hi>Spaine</hi> did not ceaſe to extoll and magnifie the offers of that
<hi>King,</hi> ſo far, that the <hi>Cardinals</hi>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:17285:88"/> of the <hi>Congregation</hi> conſulting what was to be done to reduce the <hi>Venetians</hi> to yeeld to the will of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> concluded and reported to his <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,</hi> that the ſuccours of the <hi>Catholique King</hi> would be more than ſufficient, and would not faile him, prouided that he would yeeld him that which be deſired touching <hi>Sicilie;</hi> which (as men beleeued) they ſaid, after they had tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and agreed with the <hi>Marquis de Villena,</hi> the <hi>Catholique Ambaſſador.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Spaine</hi> the <hi>Counſellors</hi> ſpake on the ſame faſhion to the <hi>Nuntio,</hi> ſaying, that if the <hi>Pope</hi> deſired fauour of their <hi>King,</hi> it was but reaſon that he ſhould yeeld ſomewhat on his ſide, for to giue ſome ſatisfaction vnto his ſubiects, to the end they might not repent themſelues to haue beene embarqued in ſuch a warre. They touched in a word the remitting of the fief o
<hi>Naples,</hi> the granting of <hi>Ferrara</hi> for the garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of their ſouldiers, and <hi>Ancona</hi> for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait of their Armie. The <hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> in the meane while in execution of the promiſes of his Maſter, ſent <hi>Don Francis de Mendozza, Captaine</hi> of the
<hi>Caſtle</hi> of <hi>Lodi,</hi> the Gouernour of <hi>Lech,</hi> and the
<hi>Captaine Lachiuga</hi> to the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Italy;</hi> diuiding among them the charge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:17285:89"/> as the commoditie of the voyage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and that for to make knowne vnto them the intention of the <hi>Catholique King,</hi> and to moue them to ioyne with him in fauour of the <hi>Pope.</hi> Theſe offices were diuerſly interpreted by thoſe <hi>Princes,</hi> who neuertheleſſe each one in particular ſent backe theſe Meſſengers with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall anſwers, none of them thinking meet to come to ſuch a declaration. But it ſeemed to the <hi>Count Fuentes,</hi> that the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Modena</hi> onely had not anſwered with ſuch readineſſe and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome as he wiſhed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> highly contented with this <hi>Letter,</hi> and with that which the <hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> had done, remained neuertheleſſe in ſuſpence, ſeeing the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of
<hi>Venice</hi> welcome in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Spaine.</hi> But the
<hi>Marquis de Villena</hi> found meanes to accord theſe actions which ſeemed contrary, ſaying that all this was done for the ſeruice of his
<hi>Holineſſe,</hi> to the end that that which the <hi>King</hi> intended to doe in his fauour might be more eaſily receiued.</p>

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:17285:89"/> For although formerly the <hi>Senate</hi> of
<hi>Venice</hi> had made ſome prouiſion, yet was it not with any deſigne to aſſaile others, nor did they thinke it would be needfull to defend themſelues from the temporall armes of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and much leſſe of any other <hi>Prince</hi> who would enterpriſe to ſerue himſelfe of this pretext for to inuade ſome part of their <hi>Eſtate,</hi> as ſometimes it had fallen out among <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> but onely by reaſon of <hi>State</hi> they made ſome light prouiſions when they ſaw the <hi>Pope</hi> reſolued to paſſe on to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</hi> For this cauſe they ſuddenly writ to the <hi>Prouiſor Generall</hi> in

            <p>But the <hi>Pope</hi> hauing regard to an euill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:17285:90"/> which was in his <hi>Eſtate</hi> (not onely for the cuſtome of the people, which are neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with a Gouernment which tends more to the commoditie of thoſe that gouerne then of them that are gouerned, but alſo for ſome particular defaults of his
<hi>Pontificate,)</hi> cauſed a reuiew to be made of men drawne out of thoſe which are appointed to carry armes within his <hi>Eſtate.</hi> He made alſo ſome feeble reparations at <hi>Rimini</hi> and at
<hi>Ancona;</hi> and to aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> where moſt danger was to be feared, hauing therein onely 500. footmen, and 45. horſe, he adioyned more a 1000. foot. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee baniſhed from
<hi>Romagna</hi> and from the <hi>Marquiſate</hi> of <hi>Ancona,</hi> all ſtrangers, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that all the Natiues ſhould come home. But hauing receiued the <hi>Letters</hi> from <hi>Spaine,</hi> he eſteemed it neceſſarie (to maintaine the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which he thought he had acquired, with ſome effects, and by the feare of Temporall armes to induce them to yeeld vnto the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,) to make the greateſt preparations of Warre that he could poſſibly, wherein not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he was many waies hindred. For firſt, there was an extreme want of victuals at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in all his <hi>Eſtate,</hi> which made men cry out at
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:17285:90"/> 
               <hi>Rome</hi> and elſewhere for
<hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Peace:</hi> which famine likewiſe afflicted the neighbouring pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; eſpecially <hi>Naples</hi> &amp;
<hi>Abruzzo;</hi> whereas on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, in the <hi>Venetian Dominions</hi> there was great abundance of all things. He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the danger of the riuer of <hi>Romagna,</hi> which lay ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; expoſed vnto incurſions, the people of that Country being well affected vnto the
<hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Name, for the great &amp; neceſſary commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>merce they receiued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. The inhabitants of <hi>Ferrara</hi> were likewiſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected by him, for remedy whereof he tooke from the
<hi>Cardinall Aldobrandin</hi> that Legation which <hi>Pope Clement</hi> the 8. had giuen him irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocably during his life. Hee tooke away alſo that of
<hi>Bologna</hi> from the <hi>Cardinall Montalto</hi> who had kept it eighteene yeeres: and created <hi>Legate</hi> at <hi>Ferrara</hi> the <hi>Cardinall Spinola,</hi> and at <hi>Bologna</hi> the <hi>Cardinall Iuſtinian,</hi> and in <hi>Romagna</hi> the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall Caietan,</hi> holding them but little affected to the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice.</hi> He made likewiſe ſome preparations, but very ſlender, in the maritime Townes. He conuayed the ſiluer ſtuffe (cups, chalices, croſſes,) from the <hi>Chappell</hi> of
<hi>Loretto,</hi> vnder pretence to keepe it ſafer. Hee ſent to
<hi>Ferrara, Lucio Sauelli,</hi> to command there. the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:17285:91"/> men of warre, where hauing cauſed the Citizens to haue beene diſarmed, and the Artillery of the Caſtle to be turned vpon the City, and all Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to be baniſhed who had not any traffique of conſideration, he increaſed the Garriſon to the number of eighteene hundred foot, and one hundred horſe, changing the Guard of the
<hi>Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadell</hi> euery ten daies out of diſtruſt; and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Armes, he tooke away thoſe of <hi>Meldola,</hi> which the <hi>Pope Clement</hi> had giuen by a <hi>Breue</hi> to <hi>Iohn Francis Aldobrandin.</hi> In
<hi>Romagna</hi> he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a new <hi>Ban,</hi> that all Strangers ſhould be gone, and the Natiues returne. He prouided <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenna</hi> of two hundred foot, <hi>Ceruia</hi> of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and <hi>Ancona</hi> only of forty, becauſe that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie would keepe it ſelfe. He put in Garriſon by the Sea-coaſts, ſome Souldiers taken out of them who were choſen in Villages to beare Armes, which he was forced often to change, becauſe they were not paid, and many ran away.</p>
            <p>The number of Souldiers ſometime encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſometime diminiſhed, according as they eſcaped, or were conſtrained to retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to their Houſes, as wanting maintenance; but it is certaine that the number of foot-men payed, was neuer aboue 1400. and the number
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:17285:91"/> of horſe 350. Hee ſent to <hi>Ancona</hi> the Colonell <hi>Fabio Ghiſleri,</hi> elected Captaine of the Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſe, who made a Liſt of 1700. Harquebuſiers, Horſe-men taken out of diuers Cities of the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clefiaſtique State,</hi> the moſt part neuertheleſſe without Armes, and without Horſes; to whom notwithſtanding he gaue no other ſtipend, but only a permiſſion to beare Armes, and therefore they could neuer be gotten together. He made further a Liſt of Captaines fit to ſerue him when he had need, which Liſt he euery where diuul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and called to his ſeruice ſome of thoſe that were in <hi>Flanders.</hi> He forbade likewiſe them of <hi>Romagna,</hi> and the
<hi>Marquiſate</hi> of <hi>Ancona</hi> to haue any comerce with the
<hi>Venetians,</hi> which quickly after he was faine to recall, hauing learned by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience that the greateſt damage herein would redound to themſelues, in as much as the <hi>Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> proteſted they would quitte the
<hi>Cuſtomes</hi> which they had farmed, and he knew not how elſe-where to haue money to pay the Souldiers. Further he prohibited the tranſportation of gold or ſiluer, aboue ten crownes; and arreſted the reuenues of all
<hi>Venetians</hi> within the lands of the Church. And at <hi>Rome</hi> to get ſiluer, was laid a new impoſition vpon Salt, vpon Fleſh and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:17285:92"/> with reſolution to lay it likewiſe vpon Wine and Timber, when he ſhould be reduced to any great neceſſity. Theſe Impoſitions being not yet ſufficient, they conſulted in Congregation how to prouide money, and in ſo difficult a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the opinions much varied. It was treated to taxe the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> whereat ſome were ſilent, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers made ſignes that they did not approue it; wherefore nothing was reſolued, but that a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidy ſhould be paid by the Orders of
<hi>Regulars,</hi> as it was indeed. I haue thought meet to ioy ne all theſe things in diſcourſe, although they were done ſucceſſiuely in diuers times by the <hi>Pope</hi> vntill the accord, that I might not interrupt the order of the negotiation which is the principall ſubiect of this
<hi>Hiſtory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Duchy</hi> of <hi>Milan</hi> there were not in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
900. <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Souldiers compriſing alſo thoſe that were in Gariſon, ſeuen Companies of Light-horſe in good order, and a ſmall number of others ill appointed. And in the Chamber there was not aboue 400000. crownes, and the Garriſons ſo ill payed, that the Souldiers in the Caſtle of <hi>Milan</hi> were neare a mutiny, had not the <hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> and the Gouernour of the Caſtle appeaſed them by giuing them ſome ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:17285:92"/> The <hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> added ſome twenty Companies of the baſer <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> making in all 1800. men, the greater part being young, raw, and without any experience in the wars, which were put in the Garriſons. He made alſo ſome muſters of Horſe-men within their quarters, that they might not be payed, who appeared on horſes for the moſt part borrowed, being not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to furniſh themſelues with horſes, vnleſſe they had receiued their pay. He brought alſo out of ranke ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Souldiers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming downe from
<hi>Monaco</hi> and <hi>Final,</hi> and made them diligently to labour at
<hi>Pauie</hi> &amp; in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Milan,</hi> for the tranſporting of the Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery. And the <hi>Pope</hi> to enduce the <hi>Count de Fuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> to ſerue him with more cheerefulneſſe, gaue many Benefices in <hi>Spaine</hi> to his kinſ-men, and to ſuch as he commended: and to aid his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, he granted him the Tenthes out of the <hi>Clergie</hi> of
<hi>Milan,</hi> although the <hi>Eccleſiaſtiques,</hi> aſſembled by the
<hi>Cardinall Borromeo,</hi> for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this Grant, did contradict it, ſaying, that the charge was new, and had neuer beene impoſed. Wherefore they reſolued humbly to intreat his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> and the <hi>Count de Fuentes,</hi> that ſuch a nouelty might not be introduced.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:17285:93"/> The <hi>Count</hi> was not earneſt in the affaire, and therefore it eaſily paſſed without execution. He made alſo a rumor to be ſcattered that he would haue an armie in readineſſe of fiue and twenty thouſand men, compoſed of <hi>Neapolitans, Dutch, Suiſſes</hi> and <hi>Spaniards;</hi> but becauſe he began not to execute this Deſigne till the yeare following, we ſhall ſpeake more thereof in due place. In the meane while the <hi>Spaniards</hi> armed at <hi>Naples</hi> ſix and twenty Gallies, to be ready vpon any exigent.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Senate</hi> at <hi>Venice</hi> did not ſo much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Preparations of the <hi>Pope,</hi> as to preuent ſome ambuſhes, and the army at Sea prouided at <hi>Naples.</hi> Therefore beſides the eight and twenty Gallies which they had ordinarily, they adioined other ten; and three great Gallies with twentie leſſer Barques, whereof each one carried fifty Souldiers. They gaue charge vnto the <hi>Prouiſor</hi> Generall in
<hi>Candie,</hi> that he ſhould ſend to <hi>Corfu</hi> the Gallies appointed for the guard of that <hi>Iſle,</hi> well ſtrengthned. They commanded all the Sea-Captaines to retaine all Veſſels, which paſſed by the <hi>Gulfe,</hi> for what place ſoeuer, and to ſend them vnto
<hi>Venice,</hi> except ſuch as had Patents from the <hi>K.</hi> of
<hi>Spaine</hi> for his affaires; which brought a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:17285:93"/> great diſorder on the Coaſts of
<hi>Romagna,</hi> and the <hi>Marquiſate</hi> of <hi>Ancona,</hi> which by this meanes were in a manner beſieged. All exportation of Corne was prohibited, euen vnto Subiects <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall;</hi> and the tranſportation of Gold and Siluer aboue ten Ducates, into the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> &amp; the Reuenues of ſuch
<hi>Eccleſiaſtiques,</hi> as were out of the <hi>State,</hi> were ſequeſtred, which brought many incommodities to the <hi>Court</hi> of
<hi>Rome,</hi> many <hi>Prelates</hi> being hereby conſtrained to abridge their Families and expences. The le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uies of men which had beene made out of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, were diſcharged to a third part, to the end that al heads of Families, and men maried ſhould be left behind, and that third amounted to the number of twelue thouſand foot-men. Beſides the Garriſons which were ordinarily kept in the Forts, they leuyed in the beginning two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<hi>Italians,</hi> ſix hundred <hi>Corſes,</hi> and an hundred and fifty
<hi>Alban</hi> Horſe, vnder three Captaines; to whom they ioyned ſix hundred more, vnder the pay accuſtomed, all which were diſtributed vpon the
<hi>Continent</hi> in ſeuerall places, ſending to this effect <hi>Nicholas Delfin</hi> to be <hi>Prouiſor</hi> on this ſide the <hi>Menzo,</hi> and
<hi>Iohn Iames Zanne,</hi> vpon the <hi>Po,</hi> and in the <hi>Poleſin</hi> of <hi>Rouigo.</hi> And the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:17285:94"/> after increaſing, they intertained ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Italian</hi> foot-men, the ordinary Bands remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which were put vnder the charge of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Gentlemen</hi> of the
<hi>Continent,</hi> Subiects of the <hi>Signiory;</hi> which were augmented the yeare fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing vnto the number of twelue thouſand foot, beſides thoſe of the former leuies, and foure thouſand horſe, as ſhall be ſaid hereafter. In the ſame time, the Cities and other particular Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, offered to contribute whenſoeuer they ſhould be commanded, and theſe offers from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places amounted to the number of ſeuen thouſand foot-men, and twelue hundred horſe, which were not leuyed, becauſe at length peace was concluded. As alſo there was no need to make vſe of thoſe <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> Subiects of the <hi>Turke,</hi> whom the
<hi>Arch-biſhop</hi> of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> a man highly eſteemed among the <hi>Greekes,</hi> as well for his good life, as for his excellent lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, offered to cauſe to come by his authority, in ſuch numbers as they would deſire, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch honeſt conditions as the
<hi>Senate</hi> ſhould iudge fit: whereunto the <hi>Turkes</hi> alſo eaſily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded. Likewiſe for the ſame reaſon they did not imploy the ſeuerall ſuccours which ſome <hi>French Lords</hi> offered, among whom the <hi>Duke
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:17285:94"/> de Maien</hi> offered to ſend his ſonnes, and the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Ionuile</hi> his nephew; and <hi>Monſieur de Boniuet</hi> (whoſe anceſtors haue beene alwaies well affected to the <hi>Republique,)</hi> was purpoſing to come himſelfe in perſon. And the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> of that <hi>Kingdome,</hi> not onely offered vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily Captaines and Souldiers, but euen ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited to be therein imployed: and although the <hi>Senate</hi> thanked them, with a purpoſe to ſerue themſelues of them if need required, yet had they a firme reſolution not to vſe them, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they were preſſed with extreme neceſſitie, as alſo not firſt to begin the Warre in <hi>Italie,</hi> but onely prepare themſelues for defence, in caſe they ſhould be aſſaulted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> for to maintaine the effect of the promiſe of his <hi>King</hi> and of his ſleights, gaue the <hi>Pope</hi> often to vnderſtand, ſometime by meanes of the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of his Maſter at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſometime by expreſſe perſons, what he purpoſed to doe, and how he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to hinder the paſſage of any ſouldiers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Italy,</hi> giuing aduiſe that hee kept a ſtrong guard on the confines of the <hi>Griſons</hi> to that end, and that he was armed in the frontiers of <hi>Venice</hi> to keepe them in awe. All this notwith
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:17285:95"/> ſtanding, the <hi>Pope</hi> knew well that by reaſon of the dearth and famine which was in <hi>Naples,</hi> the Prouiſions out of that <hi>Kingdome</hi> would goe on but ſlowly, and further he ſaw that hee could not ſatisfie the demands which were made on the behalfe of <hi>Spaine.</hi> Beſides he thought deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the words which that <hi>King</hi> had ſpoken to his <hi>Nuntio,</hi> that his purpoſe was not to moue any warre, but onely to aſſiſt the
<hi>Pope</hi> if he were aſſaulted in his owne <hi>State;</hi> for which cauſe he imagined that the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> did rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee Him loſe reputation, and the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> driuen to expences, then that the affaire ſhould be ended to his aduantage. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee lent an eare to all that ſpake of the accord, and eſpecially becauſe it was ardently deſired by his Brethren, who had a purpoſe to buy
<hi>Regnano</hi> of <hi>Lucio Sauelli,</hi> as afterward they did, notwithſtanding the need which the <hi>See Apoſtolique</hi> had of money. For theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations the <hi>Pope</hi> heard and fauoured greatly the
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King,</hi> who ſpake vnto him touching the accord; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of
<hi>Spaine</hi> did the ſame offices for a Peace, his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> neuertheleſſe hearkned more willingly to him of <hi>France,</hi> as
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:17285:95"/> well becauſe he iudged that the moſt
<hi>Chriſtian King</hi> would be more eaſily heard and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at
<hi>Venice,</hi> as alſo becauſe he could treat with the <hi>French</hi> more freely, fearing that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> would vſe more authoritie towards him.</p>
            <p>But in <hi>Spaine</hi> the <hi>Counſellors</hi> of <hi>State</hi> being come to <hi>Court,</hi> made reflexion vpon the <hi>Letter</hi> written by their <hi>King,</hi> and vpon the practiſes of the <hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> with the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie;</hi> and how it was not their intention to make Warre, but onely to ſhew that that Crowne on all occaſions would vnite with the <hi>See Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</hi> Alſo they thought it neceſſarie to let them of <hi>Venice</hi> vnderſtand ſo much, to the end that nothing might fall out againſt their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and repenting themſelues to haue ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red theſe differences to run ſo far, they iudged it expedient for their affaires to interpoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in ſome faſhion. But being deſirous to effect theſe deſignes with ſome reputation, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lerma,</hi> when the
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> had imparted vnto him all that had paſſed in this affaire, ſaid, that in the maine of theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies the <hi>Republique</hi> ſuſtained the right of all
<hi>Princes,</hi> but for the forme they might more fairely auoid the ſpirituall armes by addreſſing
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:17285:96"/> themſelues vnto the <hi>Catholique King,</hi> who would make knowne vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> what preiudice hee did vnto himſelfe by putting in hazard the obedience vnto him. He added, that the
<hi>King</hi> his Maſter had commanded his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to be inſtruments of Peace, and would haue continued, if he had not beene forced to doe the contrary, becauſe they had admitted the authoritie of ſome
<hi>Princes,</hi> who had not any intereſt in the affaires of <hi>Italy.</hi> Afterward, they endeuoured by the meanes of <hi>Count d'Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uares</hi> to perſwade the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> that he would make ſome inſtance vnto that <hi>King,</hi> if not in the name of the
<hi>Duke,</hi> at leaſt as from himſelfe, to interpoſe himſelfe in the buſineſſe. And when the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> had refuſed to doe this without commiſſion, they reſolued to deale openly; and to ſend <hi>Don Iuan de Velaſco, Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> of <hi>Caſtile</hi> into <hi>Italy</hi> without certaine inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but that they ſhould be ſent after him according to the occurrences. The <hi>Nuntio</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelfe to this iourney of the <hi>Conſtable,</hi> becauſe at <hi>Milan</hi> he had alwaies ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe very oppoſite to the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and at <hi>Ferrara,</hi> when the Ceremonies were done at the entry of the <hi>Queene</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:17285:96"/> he had much troubled the <hi>Cardinals</hi> in the point of precedencie. Wherefore they thought vpon <hi>Iohn Idiaques,</hi> and others, but to auoid delaies, it was ordained that <hi>D. Innigo de Cardenas, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador</hi> of the <hi>King Catholique,</hi> reſiding with the <hi>Signiorie,</hi> ſhould doe the firſt offices in this behalfe. Who accordingly preſenting himſelfe the 30. of <hi>Iuly</hi> to the
<hi>Senate,</hi> ſaid, that his <hi>King</hi> affecting the conſeruation of Peace, deſired that the diſguſts betweene the <hi>Pope</hi> and the
<hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> ſhould paſſe no further, but that ſome compoſition might be found out: and that to this end he had commanded all his Miniſters to imploy themſelues, and particularly had char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to pray the <hi>Republique</hi> herein, aſſuring them that whatſoeuer they ſhould thinke meet to be done to finiſh this controuerſie, would be very acceptable to his <hi>Maieſtie.</hi> To which the <hi>Duke</hi> (hauing praiſed the deſigne of the <hi>King,</hi> and thanked him) anſwered, That the <hi>Republique</hi> could not doe any more then alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy they had done, that it was meet to deale with him who had been the cauſe of all theſe broyles. And then briefly recapitulating what had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he concluded, That it was not for them to open the way which had beene ſtopt vp by
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:17285:97"/> others: That the <hi>Pope</hi> by diſmiſſing their <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador</hi> and withdrawing his
<hi>Nuntio</hi> had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off all meanes of treaty, which could not be ſet afoot, vnleſſe his Cenſures were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, with which the
<hi>Republique</hi> thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues offended and iniured. The
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> replyed, requeſting the <hi>Duke</hi> to giue him leaue to tell him, that now the queſtion being of their agreement, it was not conuenient to remember old iniuries, which could not produce good effects: That if the <hi>Republique</hi> ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, the <hi>Pope</hi> on the other ſide would doe no leſſe: That he would not thereupon enter into diſcourſe, whether the <hi>Pope</hi> had done well (which were to renue things paſt;) That if the <hi>Duke</hi> ſhould ſay they had beene onely vpon the defenſiue, yet they had beene ſo ſtiffe therein, that hereupon eſpecially the <hi>Pope</hi> complained and found himſelfe agrieued: That therefore it was meet to forget all that had paſſed, and looking onely forward to finde ſome meanes to reeſtabliſh the former vnion and Friendſhip: That the prudence of the <hi>Duke</hi> was ſuch, that it were temeritie in him for to aduenture to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him touching thoſe meanes: That it was a thing notorious to all, how the <hi>Pope</hi> ſuſteined
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:17285:97"/> a double perſon, one of the <hi>Vicar</hi> of
<hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and the other of a <hi>Prince</hi> Temporall, and that diſtinguiſhing the one from the other, it would be eaſie to ſee wherein it was conuenient to giue him ſome ſatisfaction; ſince as to a
<hi>Prince</hi> temporall men owe him no more reſpect then is due to all Soueraigne <hi>Princes,</hi> but as he is the <hi>Spirituall Prince,</hi> and
<hi>Vicar</hi> of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> there is not any who is not obliged to obey him: That the <hi>King</hi> his Maſter did not intend, that the Lawes of the <hi>Repub.</hi> (whereof was queſtion) ſhould be ſent vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> to the end that he might correct or amend them; or that they ſhould doe any thing contrary to their libertie, or preiudiciall to the dignitie of the <hi>Republique;</hi> That if the <hi>Senate</hi> had any intention to do ſuch a thing (as tending to the preiudice of all
<hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and euen of his <hi>Catholique Maieſtie)</hi> hee had order to exhort and incourage the <hi>Repub.</hi> not to doe themſelues ſuch wrong, or commit any ſuch indignitie: That they might well giue vnto the <hi>Pope</hi> ſome demonſtration of Spirituall obedience, which in ſubſtance ſhould be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The <hi>Duke</hi> hereunto anſwered, that the <hi>Republique</hi> had made appeare vnto the <hi>Pope</hi> all kinds of ſeruice and filiall reuerence, before
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:17285:98"/> that his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> came to the publication of his <hi>Cenſures,</hi> ſo as there remained no more to bee done; but the <hi>Monitorie</hi> being publiſhed, the <hi>Nuntio</hi> called away, and all communication interrupted, they could not now any longer do the ſame acts of reſpect, vnleſſe the <hi>Pope</hi> by taking off his
<hi>Cenſures</hi> ſhould open away. The <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> replyed, asking the <hi>Duke,</hi> whether (for to giue an ouerture to this end,) his
<hi>Sereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> were content that he ſhould pray his
<hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> in the name of the <hi>King</hi> to take away the Excommunication. To that the <hi>Duke</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that as formerly he had euer ſaid, ſo for the time to come he would ſay ſtill, it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to remoue the impediment. But that this ſhould be done by this meane or that, or by the free will of the <hi>Pope,</hi> or at the requeſt of ſome other, it little imported for the ſubſtance of the affaire; and that his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> might doe what pleaſed him. The
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> anſwered; Your <hi>Serenitie</hi> may well be content, that the <hi>Pope</hi> be intreated in your Name. The <hi>Duke</hi> ſaid, That for the repoſe of <hi>Italy,</hi> and to hinder ſo many miſchiefes as might follow vpon the warre if it were begun, if the
<hi>Catholique King</hi> were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that the <hi>Pope</hi> being moued on this faſhion
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:17285:98"/> would remoue his Cenſures, he would not hold it any great inconuenience to be ſo contented; that yet notwithſtanding he would giue him a more reſolute anſwer with the <hi>Senate.</hi> Then the
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> taking him at the word, immediatly anſwered, that he receiued that word from his <hi>Serenity,</hi> which was to pray the
<hi>Pope,</hi> and euen in his Name, to take away the Cenſures; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to treat with him in words of courteſie, he thought it neceſſary to adioyne, that his <hi>Serenity</hi> was ſory that he had giuen any diſguſt vnto his <hi>Holineſſe;</hi> that ſuch like words of courteſie were vaine and nothing, but yet neceſſary in this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence. The <hi>Duke</hi> replyed, that neither him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe nor the <hi>Senate</hi> had giuen any occaſion of diſguſt vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> if he had taken any him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe without cauſe, they could not helpe it; that in voluntary diſcontents, there is no other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die than a voluntary acknowledgement.</p>
            <p>The ſame day the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of <hi>France</hi> was at the Audience, where he reported, how the <hi>Pope</hi> had ſaid to
<hi>Mounſieur de Alincourt,</hi> that he had taken the voices of all the
<hi>Cardinals,</hi> which were found all conformable, and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their aduice he could not come to a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of the Cenſures, if in behalfe of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:17285:99"/> there were not made ſome demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſubmiſſion. Then he added, that haply the <hi>Pope</hi> might ſuffer himſelfe to be perſwaded by reaſon, and be induced to begin the firſt; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it was neceſſary to tell him what the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pub.</hi> would doe afterwards, otherwiſe he would neuer be moued. And therefore that it behoued the <hi>Republique</hi> to declare what they would doe, and to reſt confidently on the <hi>King,</hi> who was their Friend and Confederate, and who tooke to heart the intereſts of the <hi>Republique;</hi> that they might ſafely open themſelues to him, and ought not to beleeue that his
<hi>King</hi> had any other end ſaue only the Weale of the <hi>Signiory.</hi> The <hi>Duke</hi> anſwered, that to this matter they had ſpoken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſufficiently, and their anſwer ſent vnto the <hi>King,</hi> both by himſelfe, and by the <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> which they had with his
<hi>Maieſtie;</hi> that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was not meet, ſeeing he could not yet haue receiued any anſwer to that which had bin written and ſaid vnto the
<hi>King. Mounſieur de Freſne</hi> replyed, that he foreſaw what the
<hi>King</hi> would ſay, ſeeing that which they had written was only in generall termes; and that he was forced to preuent that which the <hi>King</hi> would ſay, being much preſſed on the ſide of <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:17285:99"/> where affaires were treated with great dignitie; that it was needful in ſome ſort to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and that the Temporalty did not receiue any preiudice by yeelding to his
<hi>Holineſſe,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>à ius Commune,</hi> to humble ones ſelfe vnto the Soueraigne <hi>Biſhops.</hi> And he adioyned, that he made this inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, beleeuing that they ſhould doe great wrong vnto the
<hi>King,</hi> and to that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which he euer bare to the
<hi>Republique,</hi> not to be confident in him, and freely to open vnto him the heart. And therefore to gratifie the <hi>King</hi> that they ſhould make this declaration, ſeeing that by means of a ſimple promiſe made to his
<hi>Maieſty,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> would be content to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the Cenſures. He put alſo in great conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration the Letter of the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> to the <hi>Pope,</hi> magnifying the promiſes of that <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Popes</hi> acknowledgement to him, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that it was no time therefore to diſguſt the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who without doubt would take it very vnkindly if they ſhould not ſpeake plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and freely with him. To this laſt point the
<hi>Duke</hi> began to anſwer, telling him, that the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was not ſuch as it was publiſhed, nor the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ſo great as men made them, and that the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelfe did not much truſt vnto them
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:17285:100"/> That the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of
<hi>Spaine</hi> euen then was come to treat with them in very milde termes, confeſſing the Reaſons of the <hi>Republique</hi> to be ſuch, as that if they yeelded, all <hi>Princes</hi> ſhould thereby be much preiudiced; and that when the <hi>Republique</hi> ſhould doe any thing not fitting, or ſhould be wronged in their Authority, the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> ſhould equally partake in the damage, becauſe of the Intereſts common to all <hi>Princes,</hi> and that it was cleare and euident, that the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> applyed himſelfe to an accord; that it was not meet to precipitate the buſineſſe, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting before what ſhould come after. Further he added, that whatſoeuer were the euent, the
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi> would neuer degenerate from the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and conſtancy of their Anceſtors. Then <hi>Mounſieur de Freſne</hi> prayed the
<hi>Duke</hi> not to take in euill part the words which he had ſaid, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a ſingular affection, and that only to ſignifie that the
<hi>Pope</hi> being aſſured that no <hi>Cardinall</hi> would conſent to the Suſpenſion, if firſt ſomething were not done at <hi>Venice,</hi> it was neceſſary to aduiſe what might be done, &amp; how farre they could yeeld, which being done, they might with all confidence communicate with his
<hi>King,</hi> as with their Friend. The <hi>Senate</hi> hauing
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:17285:100"/> conſidered the Propoſitions of theſe two
<hi>Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors,</hi> made anſwer to him of <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſaying, That it was neceſſary to apply the remedies to the part whence the euil proceeded; that in theſe Differences the <hi>Republique</hi> had not giuen any cauſe, and that all did ariſe only out of the <hi>Popes</hi> will, who had not only attempted to violate the Liberty of the <hi>Republique,</hi> and to take away their Power, but further had gone to offences and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries. Notwithſtanding ſince the <hi>King</hi> deſired to pacifie theſe Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentions, to the end that they might proceed no further, it was meet that he ſhould turne to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and there helpe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the Peace by the reuocation of his iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And when the <hi>King</hi> ſhould haue certaine word that the <hi>Pope</hi> would take away his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, the
<hi>Republique,</hi> for to gratifie his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> would be content that by forme of Office he might pray the <hi>Pope</hi> in their Name to remoue them; and they yet adioyned, that the <hi>Senate</hi> with diſpleaſure reſented that his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> had taken in euill part the Actions of a <hi>Republique</hi> ſo well deuoted to him, which had no other end but the glory of <hi>God,</hi> the conſeruation of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique tranquillity, and of that Liberty &amp; Power which <hi>God</hi> had giuen them. This ſame anſwer
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:17285:101"/> was alſo made to the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and withall, that if the <hi>King</hi> did thinke good, he might ſerue himſelf of the ſame Forme towards the <hi>Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the firſt word giuen to make ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the Negotiation, whereof when the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> ſaw there proceeded no good effect, but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſerued, that not only the <hi>Pope</hi> continued his preparations of War, but alſo made preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing inſtances with the
<hi>King Catholique,</hi> for the execution of his promiſes, that he diſpatched often into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and purſued the Deſignes of the
<hi>Count de Fuentes,</hi> to arme powerfully; they beleeued that the
<hi>Pope</hi> was farre from any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, although he ſhewed the contrary, or that poſſibly he deſired to appeare puiſſant, that he might treat with the more aduantage. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they eſteemed it neceſſary to trie in like manner what would be the intention of their Friends, in caſe they ſhould come to ſtrokes; and hereupon they writ to their
<hi>Ambaſſ.</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> for to giue aduiſe vnto the <hi>Princes</hi> with whom they reſided, that the
<hi>Pope</hi> was eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day further from all reaſonable Pacification, and went on with his warlike Prouiſions; that already the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>Spaine</hi> had declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:17285:101"/> hauing giuen his owne Letter for a pledge, with promiſe to aſſiſt him: that the <hi>Pope</hi> ſent of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into
<hi>Spaine.</hi> On the other part, that the <hi>Repub.</hi> was reſolued to doe nothing againſt their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Honour for any reſpect; that the
<hi>Senate</hi> thought it time to haue recourſe vnto their
<hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties,</hi> to vnderſtand their intentions, and what they would be pleaſed to doe, if things ſhould fall out into a manifeſt rupture. Theſe <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> had alſo charge from the
<hi>Republique,</hi> to doe what they could to ſound the intention of theſe
<hi>Kings,</hi> and to draw from them ſome reſolution. Beſides, it was deliberated to call the <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> of the one and the other
<hi>King,</hi> Reſidents at <hi>Venice,</hi> &amp; to impart vnto them the ſame things. Whereupon the <hi>Engliſh Ambaſſador</hi> (after he had thanked the <hi>Senate</hi> for this Communication, and had complained in the Name of the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Maſter,</hi> of the iniuries which were offered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Reaſon, to a <hi>Republique</hi> which merited graces and fauours,) he praiſed their Generoſity and reſolution to defend their Honour, aſſuring them that on ſo important an occaſion, they ſhould haue from his <hi>King</hi> all aid and fauour, as well in good Offices, as in Armes and ſuccours. The <hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> alſo propoſed, as from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:17285:102"/> a League with his <hi>King,</hi> and other
<hi>Princes</hi> his Friends.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of <hi>France</hi> anſwered, that the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Maſter</hi> acknowledged very well the Reaſons of the <hi>Republique,</hi> and the wrongs offered vnto them by the <hi>Pope;</hi> with whom not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they ought not to proceed too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigorouſly, giuing example of the ſubmiſſions which the <hi>King</hi> had vſed towards
<hi>Pope Clement,</hi> and exhorting the <hi>Republique</hi> to vſe all diligence to find ſome meanes to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modate theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies: adioyning neuertheleſſe, that if they ſhould come to Armes, (which he could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue) the <hi>King</hi> would aſſiſt the <hi>Signiory.</hi> That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not in caſe to beginne new Warres, that they brought nothing but words and apparences, which for certaine would not come to effects. But if that ſhould fall out, he promiſed in ample words the aſſiſtance of his <hi>King.</hi> He added further, that the <hi>Pope</hi> ſpake mildly, demanding that the Lawes might be ſuſpended, and that he would ſuſpend his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; yea whenſoeuer the <hi>Pope</hi> was aſſured that the Lawes would be ſuſpended, he would be the firſt to ſuſpend the Cenſures. Moreouer, <hi>Mounfieur de Freſne</hi> propounded another mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:17285:102"/> yet as from himſelfe: that (for to put an end to all debate, and wholly to ſtay the <hi>Pope,</hi> with aſſurance that the reaſons of the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> ſhould remaine entire,) they might remit all difficulties into the hands of the two <hi>Kings</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> who becauſe of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, and ſeeing the matter was common to all <hi>Princes,</hi> could not but approue the Lawes and actions of the <hi>Senate.</hi> Whereupon they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the great difficulties which might grow before the <hi>Pope</hi> might be made to conſent to this ouerture, and after he had conſented, how many other queſtions might ariſe before the concluſion. So it was repreſented to the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador,</hi> that this propoſition could not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; wherefore he paſſed it in ſilence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Senate</hi> aduiſed their <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> in
<hi>Spaine</hi> of all theſe propoſitions and anſwers, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to thanke the <hi>Catholique King</hi> for his offer to interpoſe in this affaire, and to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance vnto him, how needfull it was for that
<hi>Crowne</hi> to conſerue the amitie of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique,</hi> and ſo modeſtly to complaine that the deſignes of the <hi>Pope</hi> were fomented by the <hi>Letters</hi> of his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> and by the offices of ſome of his Miniſters. Whereunto the <hi>Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:17285:103"/> of <hi>Caſtile</hi> in the Name of the
<hi>King</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; That the <hi>Letter</hi> written vnto the
<hi>Pope</hi> was not for to breake the amitie which was betweene his
<hi>Maieſtie</hi> and the <hi>Republique,</hi> but onely to ſhew himſelfe a defender of the <hi>See Apoſtolique</hi> when the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould be aſſaulted in his <hi>Eſtate.</hi> Some fifteene daies after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication made to theſe <hi>Ambaſſadors,</hi> He of <hi>Spaine</hi> was at the audience, and gaue account of the <hi>Letter</hi> which his
<hi>King</hi> had written to the <hi>Pope,</hi> aſſuring them with effectuall words, that it was nothing, and that it was written onely in generall termes, ſince the <hi>King</hi> his Maſter had no intention to aſſiſt the <hi>Pope,</hi> but onely in caſe that he were ſet vpon in his owne <hi>Eſtate,</hi> by the forces of the <hi>Republique,</hi> accompanied with the Armes of forraine <hi>Princes;</hi> but otherwiſe hee had not any purpoſe to offend the <hi>Republique.</hi> And although the
<hi>Letter</hi> was written vnto the <hi>Pope</hi> with words of great affection, that this was onely to gaine credit with his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> to the end that he might more powerfully mediate an amiable agreement of theſe differences. That to this end he had required leaue of them to demand of the <hi>Pope</hi> in the name of the <hi>Repub.</hi> that he would take away the <hi>Cenſures;</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:17285:103"/> to ſignifie they were ſorry for the diſguſts of his <hi>Holineſſe.</hi> But that the commiſſion which the <hi>Senate</hi> had giuen him for to pray the <hi>Pope,</hi> was too much reſtrained, to produce any good effect; that therefore it was meet to inlarge it, as might ſeeme good to his <hi>Serenitie.</hi> And hee added further, that he aſſured the <hi>Republique</hi> on the word of a <hi>King,</hi> of this his good intention; and more, that hee knew not whether others, who made ſhew to interpoſe themſelues in this agreement, aimed ſo much at Peace, as the <hi>King</hi> his Maſter. Some men beleeued that <hi>Cardenas</hi> reſolued to doe this office, after he vnderſtood the communication which had beene made to the <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>England,</hi> and conſidered the alteration which the <hi>Letter</hi> of the <hi>Catholique King</hi> had produced, with other effects which might follow. Others held that he had receiued expreſſe commiſſion thereof from <hi>Spaine.</hi> But it is certaine, that the ſame office was done ſome few daies before in <hi>Spaine</hi> to the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of
<hi>Venice</hi> by the <hi>Conſtable</hi> of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile,</hi> ſent expreſly to tell him; That the <hi>Letter</hi> written by the <hi>King</hi> to aſſiſt his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> was not to breake the amitie which his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> had with the <hi>Republique,</hi> but onely to get reputation
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:17285:104"/> with the <hi>Pope,</hi> wth out deſigne to come to armes in his fauour, vnleſſe it were in caſe of neceſſitie when he ſhould be aſſaulted in his <hi>Eſtate.</hi> And certainly in
<hi>Spaine</hi> they employed themſelues with all ſinceritie to the Pacification: and did what was poſſible to perſwade the <hi>Nuntio</hi> to treat with the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> at leaſt in ſecret, to the end that from him hee might vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that which they thought not conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for themſelues to tell him: Particularly the aſſurance which the <hi>King</hi> gaue, that hee would not aſſiſt the
<hi>Pope</hi> but for the defence of his owne <hi>Eſtate</hi> againſt forraine Nations; and further that he might know how the <hi>Republique</hi> treated with the <hi>French.</hi> But the <hi>Nuntio</hi> would neuer conſent to treat, no not ſecretly, with the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of
<hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although the buſineſſe of the agreement was in the hands of two great <hi>Kings,</hi> neuertheleſſe the great <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Tuſcany</hi> had an exceſſiue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that by his meanes it might bee ended. Whereupon, he complained vnto the <hi>Reſident</hi> of the
<hi>Republique</hi> with him, and alſo made it knowne by his
<hi>Reſident</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> that hee had effectually employed himſelfe with the <hi>Pope,</hi> not to any other end then for the quiet of the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:17285:104"/> 
               <hi>Repub.</hi> in which hee had no other intereſt then that of amitie, his owne affaires being in good caſe, and very well ſetled. That if there had beene any correſpondence on the ſide of the <hi>Republique,</hi> by communicating vnto him their intentions, and giuing him ſome liberty to treat, hee had peraduenture brought the affaire to good termes; adding withall a large diſcourſe of the profit and aduantages of Concord, of the damages and incommodities of Warre. The <hi>Senate</hi> made anſwer to his <hi>Reſident,</hi> and gaue order to <hi>Robert Lio Secretary</hi> of the <hi>Signiorie,</hi> who was with his
<hi>Highneſſe,</hi> to let him vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; that his ſinceritie and good will was well knowne vnto them; that the offices which hee had done with the <hi>Pope</hi> were acceptable, and that his diſcourſes were very true; but the times were ſuch, that the <hi>Republique</hi> could not condeſcend to any particular propoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Cenſures</hi> were remoued; becauſe the <hi>Pope</hi> hauing interrupted all commerce and meanes of treatie, it was meet that hee ſhould open the way by taking off his
<hi>Cenſures,</hi> which way once opened they might then aduiſe vpon the propoſitions which they ſhould finde moſt proper to put an end to the differences. This
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:17285:105"/> anſwer being made by <hi>Robert Lio</hi> to the great <hi>Duke,</hi> he replied; That his intention was very good for the good of the <hi>Republique,</hi> which he would alwaies procure if he were required; that his owne affaires were not in any bad caſe that he ſhould deſire a change; that he was aged and therefore his counſels merited to be followed; that on both ſides notable faults had beene committed by paſſion, and that there was need of a Phyſitian; that they might make vſe of him to that purpoſe; that he had ſpoken freely to the
<hi>Pope,</hi> who was in ſome diffidence with him, becauſe he had not offered him ſuccours as did others; that the <hi>Pope</hi> was well inclined, but the <hi>Cardinals</hi> did ill offices; that he would yet further imploy himſelfe for the <hi>Republique,</hi> and ſpeake in their behalfe, if they thought well; otherwiſe he knew not what he could do.</p>
            <p>When the propoſition of the <hi>Senate</hi> was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued in
<hi>France,</hi> by which the <hi>King</hi> was deſired to make ſome declaration, his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; That the <hi>Nuntio</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> had required of him the ſame in the name of his
<hi>Holineſſe:</hi> But he ſaw very well that in declaring himſelfe he ſhould doe nothing elſe but render himſelfe ſuſpected on the one ſide, and conſequently
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:17285:105"/> depriue himſelfe of all power to be a Mediator for an accord, and vtterly to breake off the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie already begun. Vpon this reaſon he did not thinke fit to declare himſelfe for either partie, or to fauour the reaſons of the one or of the other; but remaining neutrall, to continue the treatie of agreement which might bee more profitable to both parties, then the declaration could be aduantageous to either of them: and ſo much the rather, becauſe he had a good hope very quickly to finiſh it; alſo that the <hi>Senate</hi> muſt needs yeeld a little, becauſe the
<hi>Pope</hi> was not vnwilling to haue all accommodated.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> although hee was much buſied by the preſence of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> his Brother in Law, in ſuch ſort that he could not thinke on any other affaire, or giue audience vnto any <hi>Ambaſſador;</hi> yet hauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that
<hi>Iuſtimano,</hi> the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> had ſomething to ſay vnto him, he heard him; and after hee had vnderſtood all the progreſſe and ſucceſſe of matters paſſed, with the demand of the <hi>Senate,</hi> He anſwered; That he was much comforted to vnderſtand the Conſtancie of the people, and the Vnion of the <hi>Senate,</hi> to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their proper liberty, of Iuſtice, and of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:17285:106"/> the Power giuen by <hi>God</hi> to all
<hi>Princes.</hi> Hee laughed at the declaration of <hi>Spaine</hi> made only by a <hi>Letter,</hi> ſaying, that he who will come to effects is not wont to giue words; that He was obliged to the <hi>Repub.</hi> for the affection which they had teſtified to him, and for their demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Honour towards Him in ſending their <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> Ordinarie and Extra ordinarie. And therefore that there was contracted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them an amitie reciprocall and ſincere; ſo as there ſhould neuer be occaſion of rupture betweene the <hi>Republique</hi> and Him; that Hee could not ſay ſo much for others. But for that which the <hi>Senate</hi> then demanded, He held him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe obliged to condeſcend; Firſt, becauſe in iudgement He approued the actions of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique:</hi> and ſecondly, ſince they had a great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence in Him, that He ſhould ſhew himſelfe ingratefull and vniuſt, if He refuſed to protect a cauſe ſo righteous, wherein the
<hi>Senate</hi> onely defended themſelues from oppreſſion, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteined their liberty together with the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of all
<hi>Princes;</hi> that it was indeed a prudent aduiſe to proceed herein with dexteritie to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid Warre and Troubles; but if the violence of others would needs bring all to a rupture,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:17285:106"/> the <hi>Senate</hi> might reſt aſſured that in the word of a <hi>Prince</hi> hee would aſſiſt the
<hi>Republique</hi> with all his forces: That he had giuen charge to his
<hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> at <hi>Venice</hi> to performe more amply the ſame Office; not being able then to ſay more for the preſence of the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke.</hi> The <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Salisbury</hi> by commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the <hi>King,</hi> confirmed the ſame things to the
<hi>Ambaſſadour,</hi> and added thereunto that the <hi>King</hi> was not moued to aſſiſt the <hi>Republique</hi> for any deſigne that he had to diuide the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the <hi>Romane Church</hi> from their Head: that he knew well they meant not to leaue their own Religion, wherein he did not blame them; that he was carried to this reſolution by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration which the
<hi>Spaniard</hi> had made for the <hi>Pope:</hi> that his intention onely was to oppoſe himſelfe to thoſe who aſſaied to depriue <hi>Princes</hi> of their Libertie, and to aid thoſe that would ſuſtaine and defend it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> of <hi>England</hi> at <hi>Venice</hi> ſpake on the ſame manner, ſaying, That he had parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Commandement from the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> to oblige him vnder the Word of a <hi>King,</hi> to a neere Vnion with the <hi>Republique,</hi> to aſſiſt them with Connſell and Forces, as alſo to labour with
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:17285:107"/> all his Friends that they ſhould doe the ſame, nor for any baſe ends or priuate intereſts, nor for to foment a diuiſion, nor to come into concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or oppoſition with any other
<hi>Prince;</hi> but eſpecially for two Reaſons. Firſt, for that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging himſelfe obliged to God for infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite fauours receiued from him, he thought it his duty to defend his Cauſe, that is, to conſerue that Power which his Diuine <hi>Maiestie</hi> had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed vpon earth. Secondly, becauſe of that Bond of Amity renewed with the <hi>Republique.</hi> The <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> hereunto added, that he had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the
<hi>King</hi> to publiſh or to keepe ſecret this Declaration, according as it ſhould ſeeme moſt expedient to the <hi>Republique.</hi> The
<hi>King</hi> was thanked in the Perſon of his <hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> with many words, as alſo <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> their <hi>Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour</hi> with his <hi>Maiestie</hi> had charge to doe the ſame; and further, a Letter was written vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that <hi>King,</hi> with ſuch thankfulneſſe as was meet.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> of <hi>France</hi> a few dayes after that the Anſwer of his <hi>King</hi> was arriued, and haply to ſweeten it, came to the Audience, where he made a long Diſcourſe for the Accord, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding that though it ſhould not fall out, yet
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:17285:107"/> the <hi>King</hi> would not depart from the Amity which he had with the <hi>Republique.</hi> That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his
<hi>Maieſtie</hi> deſired to be throughly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of their Reaſons, not only for the merit and iuſtice of the Lawes, and other things contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, but alſo touching the order which they had holden in oppoſing the Cenſures of the <hi>Pope,</hi> who complained not only of the things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, but that he had receiued ſome new of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, both for hindring Nauigation into places of the <hi>Church,</hi> and for baniſhing vtterly out of their <hi>Eſtate</hi> the Order of the <hi>Ieſuites.</hi> To which by decree of <hi>Senate</hi> was made anſwer, thanking the <hi>King</hi> for his good and ſincere affection, and alſo there was giuen in writing to the
<hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi> a briefe Summary of their Reaſons, for iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification as well of the Lawes and of the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as of that which the <hi>Senate</hi> and the other <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> had done to repulſe the iniuries of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and to hinder the Seditions which the Cenſures might haue occaſioned. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint touching Nauigation was alſo reſolued, ſaying that it appertained to euery good Gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to prouide that the <hi>State</hi> might be furniſhed with things neceſſary, not letting that be caried away to others, whereof it ſelfe ſtands in need; that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:17285:108"/> the <hi>Republique</hi> had ſtayed all Veſſels at Sea, wherein were prouiſions neceſſary for the
<hi>State;</hi> whereupon, if it followed that the <hi>State Eccleſiaſticall</hi> were in ſome want, this was not their fault, but the order of humane things ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. Concerning the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> that they had not beene baniſhed, but rather were gone away of themſelues, as not being willing to obey the Commandement giuen vnto them, to continue the Diuine Seruice; but after their departure hauing notice of an infinite number of iniuries, Machinations, and Treaſons by them contriued, the
<hi>Senate</hi> had ordained (as Iuſtice required) that they ſhould neuer more returne. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>King</hi> had promiſed to continue his ſincere Amity with the <hi>Republique,</hi> yet he would neuer employ himſelfe in any particular thing which might aid their Cauſe; on the contrary, when their <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> requeſted his
<hi>Maieſtie</hi> to hinder the leuy of <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> which the
<hi>Pope</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to make, and to fauour the leuy of the
<hi>Republique;</hi> he did refuſe, ſaying, it was a meanes to make him declare himſelfe, which he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to doe, but ſhewing himſelfe neutrall to treat the Agreement; ſaying beſides that it was needleſſe for the <hi>Republique</hi> to make ſo great
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:17285:108"/> prouiſion of Armes, it being ſufficient to haue their owne Places well furniſhed.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hileſt theſe things were thus in treaty, the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> attempted to imbroile the <hi>Republique</hi> with the

But their Proiect was ſo farre from ſucceſſe, that on the contrary there had falne vpon them a great miſchiefe, if by the prudence of the
<hi>Senate</hi> it had not beene diuerted. The occaſion was this. The
<hi>Marquis de Santa Croce,</hi> being departed from <hi>Naples</hi> (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had receiued Benediction from the <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,)</hi> with ſix and twentie Gallies, he paſſed to <hi>Meſsina,</hi> where he ſtrengthened himſelfe with fourteene more; and hauing aduice that the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> Armie was at <hi>Corfu,</hi> hee ſailed very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, ſtriking his Maſts that he might not be

<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which he ſet free as ſoone as he came to
<hi>Otranto:</hi> he tooke alſo thirty peeces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, the ſmalleſt he carryed away, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to leaue the greater cloyed, for feare of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> who came with Forces vnto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue.

<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> was called, and the <hi>Duke</hi> greatly complained vnto him, ſaying, That for a trifle they would prouoke the

<hi>Spaniard</hi> on the one ſide, they would doe it on the other: and that the <hi>Grand Seigneur</hi> had writ to all his <hi>Miniſters</hi> to lend all ſorts of aid to the <hi>Republique,</hi> without expecting any further order from the Port.</p>
            <p>A few dayes after, the Army of the <hi>Turkes</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the
<hi>Gomenices,</hi> not farre from <hi>Corfu,</hi> to the number of 55. Gallics, commanded by <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phar Baſhaw;</hi> to whom the <hi>Generall Paſqualigo,</hi> who was then at <hi>Corfu,</hi> and commanded the
<hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> Army, hauing ſent <hi>Victor Barbaro</hi> his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary for to viſit Him, and to complaine of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:17285:110"/> ſome ſmall damages done by ſome Galeots of <hi>Corſares, Iapher</hi> ſpeedily diſpatched twenty Gallies to take them, which accordingly they did, and hanged the Captaine. The
<hi>Baſhaw</hi> further diſcourſed vnto the Secretary of the great eſteeme which the <hi>Grand Seignieur</hi> made of the <hi>Republique.</hi> To which he adioyned, that he had commandement from his <hi>Maſter,</hi> by his <hi>Letters</hi> of the fifth of <hi>September,</hi> to ioyne himſelfe with the <hi>Venetian</hi> Forces, to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Pope</hi> and the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> in ſuch manner as he ſhould be aduiſed by the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Captaines,</hi> or elſe to march ſeuerally if they ſhould iudge it better. And the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> ſent three of his Gallies to the Generall <hi>Paſqualigo,</hi> with the <hi>Bei</hi> of
<hi>Damita,</hi> him of <hi>Scio,</hi> and of <hi>Aſſan,</hi> Surnamed
<hi>Ianarin,</hi> a <hi>Genoan</hi> by Nation, for to giue him account of the Order which he had from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and thereupon to ſollicite his reſolution. To this Office the Generall of the <hi>Venetians</hi> correſponded, praiſing and than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the <hi>Grand Seignieur;</hi> yet he added that it was meet to giue aduice of this Propoſition at <hi>Venice,</hi> and from thence to expect a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The <hi>Turkes</hi> offered a light Galley to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the Voyage more ſpeedily, the returne
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:17285:111"/> whereof they would expect. But the Generall alledging the length of time, and the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity which the Armie might ſuffer, if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſo many dayes at Sea, wrought in ſuch ſort that they retired, giuing them to vnderſtand that they ſhould be aduertiſed what reſolution was taken.</p>
            <p>In this Moneth of <hi>August</hi> was begunne a kinde of Warre by Writing, offenſiue on the <hi>Popes</hi> part, and defenſiue on the ſide of the <hi>Republique,</hi> handled on both parts with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much heat, and which ſerued greatly to the Negotiation which was in treating. For though it was certaine, that the <hi>Pope</hi> was the firſt that aſſailed the
<hi>Republique</hi> with this ſort of Weapons, neuertheleſſe, he was ſo farre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiour in the euent, that this was one of the principall Cauſes which incited him to an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, and he ſuffered more in his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by theſe Writings, then the <hi>Republique,</hi> by the continuation of the Cenſures.</p>
            <p>The beginning and progreſſe hereof was thus. After that the
<hi>Republique</hi> had hindered the execution of the <hi>Cenſures,</hi> by ſuch reaſons, ſuch dexteritie and conſtancie, as before wee haue mentioned, the <hi>Pope,</hi> who ſaw himſelfe
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:17285:111"/> blamed by the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> for his inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate proceedings in this affaire, trauelled on his ſide to finde ſome Reaſons, and commanded Some to ſtudie theſe matters: then in the end reſolued to publiſh his Motiues, and cauſed a Writing to be framed by <hi>Scipio Gobellucci</hi> (to whom he gaue for recompence the Office of a <hi>Secretarie,</hi> which he was wont to ſell,) which Writing he ſent to <hi>Mantua, Milan, Cremona,</hi> and <hi>Ferrara,</hi> to the end that it might be diſperſed in all Quarters. He ſent it likewiſe into
<hi>Spaine</hi> to his <hi>Nuntio,</hi> not only for his Inſtruction, but alſo that it might be diuulged. Hereupon at <hi>Venice</hi> ſome propoſed that it was neceſſarie to publiſh in like ſort the Reaſons of the
<hi>Repub.</hi> as well to oppoſe the foreſaid Writing, as becauſe it was a thing earneſtly deſired by the Subiects; and ſo much the more, for that hauing in their <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of the 6. of <hi>May,</hi> ſpoken of the nullitie of the <hi>Monitorie,</hi> it ſeemed requiſite that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons thereof ſhould bee explained and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and how the <hi>Letters</hi> of the <hi>Duke</hi> were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by good and cleare arguments. And that which incited them yet more, was an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice that the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> no leſſe paſſionate in this affaire then the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelfe, went vp and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:17285:112"/> downe ſaying, perſwading, and declaiming in their Chaires and alſo writ vnto their adherents within the
<hi>State,</hi> that if the <hi>Republique</hi> had any Reaſons they would haue manifeſted them: but that it ſufficed them in generall to ſay they had many Reaſons, being not able to particularize in any. Others ſaid that they had done enough for a ſufficient defence, and that it was not meet to ſay any more till they were forced: and this aduiſe preuailed, for the great reuerence which the <hi>Republique</hi> carried to the <hi>See Apoſtolique:</hi> thinking it more fit to faile in ſome point of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, then to giue any ſigne of diſreſpect vnto that <hi>See,</hi> although they had receiued from it ſo manifeſt iniuries. Yet it was not poſſible to retaine ſome liuely wits, that they ſhould not write ſomewhat by ſtealth; hence there came abroad diuers Diſcourſes on both ſides, but yet onely in hand-writing. Diuers <hi>Letters</hi> were alſo written vnder fained Names to gaine the more credit, and in particular, one in the Name of the <hi>Senate</hi> vnto the <hi>Cities</hi> their Subiects. It is true (as hath beene ſaid) that there was one written and read in all the Counſels of <hi>Cities,</hi> but not any Copies thereof were giuen to any. It may be that ſome perſon of learning hauing
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:17285:112"/> heard it read, and committing it (as he thought) to memorie, did afterwards ſet downe in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting rather that which he imagined he had heard then that which he heard indeed; or elſe, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtile of the <hi>Senate</hi> too modeſt, too reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and reuerent, he adioyned thereunto of his owne ſome biting and eager words to fit it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the taſte of the vulgar, and ſo let it runne vnder hand among the People. But at <hi>Milan</hi> there fell out an accident of moſt pernicious conſequence, where ſome <hi>Ecclefiaſtiques</hi> of great qualitie cauſed to imprint (without the name of the Author or of the Place) a Writing of one ſheet of paper very ſeditious, wherein was affirmed, againſt all ſound doctrine, that Mariages within the <hi>State</hi> of the
<hi>Republique</hi> were inualide, the Matrimoniall coniunction Adultery, and the Children all Baſtards; that it was not onely lawfull, but euen meritorious, for <hi>Paſtors</hi> to abandon their Flockes. And to conceale the Place where this was printed, they forbade the <hi>Printer</hi> very ſtraitly, euen vnder paine of <hi>Cenſures,</hi> that he ſhould not giue any one <hi>Copie</hi> thereof within <hi>Milan.</hi> The ſheet was therefore diſtributed in the Confines of <hi>Berga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, Breſcia</hi> and
<hi>Crema.</hi> To contradict this Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:17285:113"/> a certaine Perſon publiſhed ſome Treatiſes written 150. yeeres agoe by <hi>Iohn Gerſon,</hi> ſo well fitted to the affaires of this time that they ſeem'd to be written on this occaſion, and ſuch as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely at this day none could write ſo well and ſo reſolutely. Hereunto was adioyned a <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> without the name of the Author, whereby the <hi>Curates</hi> were exhorted to take care of their Churches, and not to feare the offence of <hi>God</hi> by not obſeruing the <hi>Interdict.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> the 27. of
<hi>Iune,</hi> prohibited by name this laſt Writing, and alſo the others not yet imprinted, vnder paine of Excommunication for them that read or kept them: alledging for reaſon, that they contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned many propoſitions, raſh, ſcandalous, ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous, ſeditious, ſchiſmaticall and hereticall, with this clauſe, <hi>reſpectiue,</hi> to make all ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous. In the end, they brake off ſilence at <hi>Rome,</hi> whence came out a little Booke of
<hi>Cardinall Bellarmines</hi> againſt the Treatiſes of <hi>Gerſon,</hi> and a little after the Admonition of <hi>Cardinall Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> full of railing ſpeeches and detractions, as alſo a Diſcourſe of <hi>Cardinall Colonna,</hi> hoping by ſuch Writings to moue the fidelitie of all ſorts of perſons; foraſmuch as <hi>Card. Colonna</hi>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:17285:113"/> had indeuoured to terrifie the
<hi>Prelates</hi> and other <hi>Eccleſiaſtiques</hi> placed in the greateſt charges by the feare of <hi>Cenſures,</hi> and the priuation of their Dignities and Benefices. <hi>Card. Bellarmine</hi> aimed to ſhake the deuout conſciences by exalting the authoritie of the <hi>Pope</hi> ſo far as to make it equall to that of <hi>God.</hi> And <hi>Card. Baronius</hi> thought by his reuiling and declaiming to draw to his cauſe all learned Perſons. They did not beleeue at <hi>Rome</hi> that any would be found ſo bold as to oppoſe himſelfe to the reputation of theſe great
<hi>Cardinals,</hi> conſidering their high and eminent qualitie; as alſo they hoped to finde that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance among the people which they had long laboured to breed and bring in. But at <hi>Venice,</hi> to the end that no weake conſcience might be troubled by the Hyperbolees of <hi>Card. Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> he was ſpeedily anſwered, to diſcouer the truth, and to ſhew vnto all what obedience a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> owes to the Soueraigne
<hi>Biſhop;</hi> where alſo the publique Reaſons were manifeſted, &amp; the three Ordinances of the <hi>Republique</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, together with their Authority to iudge and puniſh <hi>Eccleſiaſtiques,</hi> which the
<hi>Pope</hi> in his <hi>Monitorie</hi> had oppugned; with other Writings, intituled, <hi>Conſiderations and Aduiſes.</hi> And in as
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:17285:114"/> much as it ſeemed neceſſarie to giue account to all the world, that the commandement made by the <hi>Republique</hi> for the continuation of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Seruice was iuſt and lawfull, they iudged expedient to proue it, by a <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict:</hi> and withall the <hi>Senate</hi> gaue permiſſion to imprint other Bookes in fauour of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, prouided that men ſhould obſerue herein the Lawes which the <hi>State</hi> preſcribed, that is, that there ſhould be nothing written contrary to faith, good maners, &amp; the Authoritie of
<hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> And becauſe the <hi>Inquiſitor</hi> was not able to examine all Writings which were preſented to be allowed to the Preſſe, there were deputed fiue <hi>Diuines</hi> together with the <hi>Patriarchall Vicar</hi> and the <hi>Diuine</hi> of the <hi>Repub.</hi> to take care of thoſe matters.</p>
            <p>As ſoone as theſe foreſaid Writings appeared in <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> preſently cenſured them, by particular name, becauſe (as they ſaid) they contained hereſies, errors and ſcandals, with the ordinary clauſe, <hi>reſpectiuè:</hi> and adioyned a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of all other Writings which ſhould be made againſt the
<hi>Interdict,</hi> whether in Print or Manuſcript, ſo as they might not be read or kept without incurring the penalty of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:17285:114"/> and reſeruation of their abſolution. Theſe prohibitions which might (conſidering the terrors of Excommunication) haue repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all Writings to be made in fauour of the
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique,</hi> did not withſtanding produce a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect, foraſmuch as many did hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that reaſon could not ſtand on their ſide, who would not ſuffer the Reaſons of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be read and publiſhed. Others ſaid, that theſe three <hi>Cardinals</hi> had diſguiſed the truth, and would not that it ſhould be diſcouered. Others thought ſtrange that all Writings which might be made were prohibited; as if they pretended to haue the ſpirit of prophecie to foreſee that men could write nothing good, or elſe of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to extinguiſh indifferently the good with the euill. There were ſome who from this Prohibition collected, that in thoſe Writings was nothing worthy of Cenſure, ſeeing that the
<hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> had not the boldneſſe to note a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular, and by this Aduerbe <hi>Reſpectiuè,</hi> they had reſerued to themſelues a ſhrowd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all obiections. Whereupon, ſome propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that for their owne defence againſt ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries, it was meet by publique decree to prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite all Writings compoſed in fauour of the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:17285:115"/> 
               <hi>Pope.</hi> But others repreſented that this would be to imitate that which they reprehended in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: that the free courſe of theſe Writings would be for the aduantage of the
<hi>Republique,</hi> and that hereby men ſhould ſee that on their part no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was palliated or diſguiſed, neither that they diſtruſted the iudgement of the World vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they had done. This opinion preuailed in ſuch ſort, that not onely the Writings in this Cauſe were tolerated, but alſo the publique fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of them permitted, and Liberty giuen to bring them into the <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching them that held for the <hi>Pope,</hi> it is to be noted, that all that time which paſſed from <hi>Iuly</hi> to that <hi>Aprill</hi> wherein the Peace was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, all ſorts of Perſons ſtriued to be writing to gaine the good grace of his <hi>Holineſſe.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there were publiſhed many Treatiſes, as well of <hi>Ieſuites</hi> as of others, partly vnder true names, partly vnder fained; to which Learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made anſwers to repell their ſlanders, and to confure thoſe falſe Doctrines which they attempted to ſcatter.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Writers was, in ſumme; That
<hi>God</hi> hath eſtabliſhed two Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the World, the one Spirituall, and the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:17285:115"/> other Temporall, each one of them being ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and independent vpon the other. The one is the
<hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> Miniſtery, the other is the <hi>Ciuill</hi> Gouernment. Of the Spirituall he hath giuen the care vnto the
<hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and to their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; of the Temporall the charge is put in the hands of <hi>Princes,</hi> in ſuch ſort, that one may not intermeddle in that which appertaines to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no power to abrogate the Lawes of <hi>Princes</hi> in Temporall matters, nor to depriue them of their <hi>Eſtates,</hi> or free their Subiects from their Allegeance which they owe vnto them; that to depoſe <hi>Kings</hi> from their <hi>Eſtates</hi> is a new thing, neuer attempted till with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this fiue hundred years, againſt the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and the examples of
<hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and of his <hi>Saints;</hi> and that to teach that in caſe of controuerſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the <hi>Pope</hi> and a <hi>Prince,</hi> it is lawful to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue him by frauds and open force, or that the Subiects which rebell againſt him, doe by that meanes obtaine remiſſion of their ſinnes, is a Doctrine ſeditious and ſacrilegious; that
<hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall</hi> men by Diuine Law are not exempted from the Secular Power, neither in their perſons nor in their goods; but haue receiued from godly and deuout <hi>Princes,</hi> ſince <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:17285:116"/> Great, vntill <hi>Fredericke</hi> the ſecond, diuers Priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges both reall and perſonall, greater or leſſer according to the exigence of times and places; which hath bin alſo practiſed in other Realmes and Principalities, being alwayes exempted (as well by <hi>Emperours,</hi> as other <hi>Princes)</hi> from the power of inferiour <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> but not from their owne Soueraigne authority. That the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions granted by <hi>Popes</hi> vnto the Order of the
<hi>Clergie</hi> haue not beene admitted in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and in others admitted only in part, and that they haue been valide only ſo farre as they haue beene receiued; that notwithſtanding any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption, the <hi>Prince</hi> hath ſtill Power ouer their perſons and goods whenſoeuer neceſſity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraines him to ſerue himſelfe of them And if at any time they ſhould abuſe ſuch Exemption to the perturbation of the publique tranquillitie, that the <hi>Prince</hi> is obliged to prouide a remedy. Another point of their Doctrine was, that the <hi>Pope</hi> ought not to thinke himſelfe infallible, vnleſſe where <hi>God</hi> hath promiſed him his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine aſſiſtance; which ſome Moderne Doctors ſay to bee onely in neceſſary points of Faith, and when hee vſes fit meanes to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, of diuine Inuocation and of <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall</hi>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:17285:116"/> conſultations. But the authority of Bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and Looſing ought to bee vnderſtood with this Caution, <hi>claue non crrante,</hi> ſeeing God hath commanded the <hi>Paſtor</hi> to follow the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Iuſtice of the Cauſe, and not his owne inclination: that when the <hi>Pope</hi> vpon any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with <hi>Princes,</hi> paſſes on to thunder out his Cenſures, it is permitted vnto the Doctors to conſider whether he hath proceeded <hi>claue er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante aut non errante.</hi> And the
<hi>Prince</hi> when he is aſſured that the Cenſures thundred againſt him, his <hi>Eſtates</hi> and ſubiects are inualide, may and ought, for the conſeruation of publique peace, hinder the execution thereof, preſeruing his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the reuerence due to the <hi>Church;</hi> and that according to the doctrine of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> the Excommunication of a multitude, or of Him who commandeth, and is followed by a great number of people, is pernicious and ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; that the new name of Blinde Obedience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by <hi>Ignatius Loiola</hi> vnknown to the Ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>Church</hi> and to al good Diuines, taketh away the eſſence of that vertue, (which ought to work by certain knowledge and election,) expoſeth vs to the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of offending
<hi>God,</hi> doth not excuſe him who is deceiued by the Ghoſtly Father, and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:17285:117"/> may ingender ſeditions, as it hath beene ſeene within theſe forty yeares ſince that abuſe hath beene introduced.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, the Doctrine of the <hi>Romane</hi> Writers, or
<hi>Papalins,</hi> affirmed; That the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Power of <hi>Princes</hi> is ſubordinate to the Power <hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> and ſubiect to it; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath authority to depriue
<hi>Princes</hi> of their <hi>Eſtates</hi> for their faults and errors which they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit in Gouernment, yea though they haue not committed any fault, when the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhall iudge it fit for the good of the <hi>Church;</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> may free Subiects fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and from their oath of Fidelity which they owe vnto their <hi>Princes,</hi> in which caſe they are obliged to caſt off all ſubiection, and euen to purſue the
<hi>Prince,</hi> if the <hi>Pope</hi> command it. And although they all agreed to hold theſe Maximes, yet they were not at accord touching the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; for they that were touched with a little ſhame, ſaid, ſo great an authority did not reſide in the <hi>Pope,</hi> becauſe <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> had giuen him any Temporall authority, but becauſe this was neceſſary for the Spirituall. Wherefore <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> giuing Spirituall authority, had giuen alſo <hi>indirectly</hi> the Temporall: which was a vain ſhift,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:17285:117"/> ſeeing they made no other difference then of Words. But the greater part of theſe men ſpake plainly, that the
<hi>Pope</hi> hath all Authority in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, both Spirituall and Temporall, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all <hi>Princes</hi> of the World no otherwiſe then ouer his Subiects and vaſſals: that he might cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them for any fault whatſoeuer: that he is a Temporall Monarque ouer all the earth: that from any Temporall Soueraigne <hi>Prince</hi> men might appeale to the <hi>Pope:</hi> that he might giue Lawes to all <hi>Princes,</hi> and annull thoſe which were made by Them. For the Exemption of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiastiques,</hi> they all with one voyce denied, that they held it by the grace and priuiledge of
<hi>Princes,</hi> although their Lawes to that purpoſe, Conſtitutions, and Priuiledges be yet extant; but they were not agreed how they had receiued it, ſome of them affirming that it was <hi>de iure diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no;</hi> others that it came by Conſtitutions of <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Councels.</hi> But all conſented vpon this, that they are not Subiects to the <hi>Prince</hi> euen in caſe of treaſon, and that they are not bound to obey the Lawes vnleſſe it were <hi>vi directiuâ:</hi> And ſome paſſed ſo farre as to ſay, that the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiastiques</hi> ought to examine whether the Lawes &amp; Commands of the Prince beiuſt, and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:17285:118"/> whether the people be obliged to obey them, and that they owe not vnto the <hi>Prince</hi> either contributions, or cuſtomes, or obedience: that the <hi>Pope</hi> cannot erre or faile becauſe he hath the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> and therefore that it is neceſſary to obey his Commandements whether they be iuſt or vniuſt: that to Him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaines the clearing of all difficulties, ſo as it is not lawfull for any to depart from his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor to make reply though the reſolution be vniuſt: that though all the World differ in opinion from the
<hi>Pope,</hi> yet it is meet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to yeeld to Him, and he is not excuſed from ſinne who followes not his aduice, though all the world iudge it to be falſe. Their bookes were alſo full of ſuch other Maximes, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is a <hi>God</hi> vpon earth, a Sunne of iuſtice, a Light of religion; that the iudgement and ſentence of <hi>God</hi> and the
<hi>Pope</hi> is one ſame thing, as alſo the Tribunall and the Court of the
<hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>God:</hi> that to doubt of the power of the <hi>Pope</hi> is as much as to doubt of the power of God. And it is notable what <hi>Card. Bellarmine</hi> hath boldly written, that, to reſtraine the obedience due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Pope</hi> to things concerning the Saluation of the Soule, is to bring it to nothing: that Saint
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:17285:118"/> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> appealed to <hi>Caeſar</hi> who was not his Iudge, and not to S. <hi>Peter</hi> leſt the by-ſtanders ſhould haue laughed at him: that the holy Biſhops of old ſhewed themſelues ſubject to Emperors, becauſe the times ſo required. Others adioyned further, that then it was meet to introduce the Empire of the
<hi>Pope</hi> by little and little, it being a thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable to deſpoile <hi>Princes</hi> newly conuerted of their <hi>Eſtates,</hi> and alſo to permit ſome thing vnto them for to intereſſe them. Other like diſcourſes they made, which many godly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons abhorred to read, and reputed them blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the manner of treating on the one part and on the other, was very different; inaſmuch as the Writings of the <hi>Popes</hi> partiſans and eſpecially of the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> were full of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, detractions, iniuries and ſlanders againſt the
<hi>Republique;</hi> and their <hi>Doctors,</hi> full alſo of many motiues to ſedition. But the Writings of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> following the intention of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> were full of all kinds of reſpect vnto the
<hi>Pope,</hi> and of modeſtie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> towards them who had written in his fauour; preſſing the matter in hand without digreſſions, and without nothing the faults of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> not for want of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:17285:119"/> good information (being ſo many and ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to all the World,) but onely to vſe all due ſeemelineſſe; which is, not to paſſe from the matter to the perſons, as doe thoſe who faile of reaſons. All this may be euidently ſeene in the Recollections printed in diuers places and in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Languages, wherein are contained the Writings of both parties.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not well pleaſed with the publication of theſe Writings, and they ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> that it was better to proceed herein by his ſole Authority; foraſmuch as Books gaue matter of diſcourſe vnto the World, and occaſion to each one to frame his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with diminution of the <hi>Popes</hi> authority. Eſpecially that they of his ſide had too far trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon the Authority of
<hi>Princes,</hi> which could not bring any aduantage to the Church; as alſo that they did more abound with reuilings then with reaſons: beſides that, each propoſition drew to it ſelfe an Anſwer. Alſo Father
<hi>Soſa</hi> a <hi>Franciſcane</hi> was reprehended, for Writing in
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> vpon this matter, and he was inioyned to call in all the Copies of his Booke, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he did. And at the inſtance of the
<hi>Nuntio</hi> they conſented that all theſe Writings
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:17285:119"/> ſhould be forbidden, not by the
<hi>Counſell</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> (as was deſired) but by the
<hi>Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And leſt the Proteſtation of the <hi>Prince</hi> ſhould be included, they ſpecified by name in the <hi>Cenſure</hi> all Writings imprinted, ſaue onely that, cenſuring the <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> in generall tearmes, in the end commanding that for the time to come none ſhould write in this cauſe for the one ſide or for the other. Not withſtanding this <hi>Edict</hi> was not imprinted nor affixed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting themſelues onely to haue it publiſhed throughout the Pariſhes (which are Churches leſſe frequented.)</p>
            <p>By occaſion of theſe Writings, in <hi>Milan</hi> was like to haue followed a great diſorder. For as they were greedily read by ſome in ſecret, ſo were they by ſome ill affected, bitterly reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with calumnies and iniuries (familiar to the <hi>Eccleſiaſtiques:)</hi> which
<hi>Antony Paulucci</hi> Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Repub.</hi> could not endure, and gaue te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of his diſlike. Whereupon a Proceſſe was formed againſt him in the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> which being come to his knowledge, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained thereof to the <hi>Count de Fuentes,</hi> who maruailed at their preſumption, and promiſed to take ſpeedy order for his quietneſſe. But a
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:17285:120"/> few daies after a <hi>Notary</hi> of the
<hi>Office</hi> cited him in the name of the <hi>Inquiſitor;</hi> to whom he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he was a publique Perſon, and vnder the protection of the
<hi>Count,</hi> and that he owed no obedience to any beſides his
<hi>Prince;</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Notary to proceed againſt him on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other faſhion. The <hi>Count</hi> aduertiſed hereof, ſent for the
<hi>Inquiſitor,</hi> and ſignified to <hi>Paulucci</hi> that he might come ſecurely to the Audience. Yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Count</hi> had talked with the
<hi>Inquiſitor,</hi> he ſaid to <hi>Paulucci,</hi> that he publiſhed too freely the Reaſons of the <hi>Repub.</hi> and that he ſhould doe well to goe to the <hi>Inquiſitor,</hi> who had one word to ſpeake vnto him, and no more. <hi>Paulucci</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to ſubmit himſelfe to any whomſoeuer without Commiſſion from his <hi>Prince.</hi> The <hi>Count</hi> offred to ſend along the <hi>Treaſurer Torni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ello</hi> to accompany him to the
<hi>Office,</hi> who ſhould ſtay with him till the <hi>Inquiſitor</hi> had taken his anſwere, and then conduct him backe vnto his houſe. For which
<hi>Paulucci</hi> thanked him, but ſaid hee could not doe it without leaue. Wherefore the <hi>Count</hi> ſent to tell him that hee would not trouble him any further, or take more knowledge of the matter. The <hi>Secretary</hi> gaue aduice of all to <hi>Venice;</hi> whereupon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:17285:120"/> was preſently made to the
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and all that their
<hi>Secretary</hi> had done was approued. The <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> hauing written here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vnto the <hi>Count,</hi> he called <hi>Paulucci</hi> telling him, that he had ſpoken too boldly of theſe affaires, and that it behoued him to giue no ſcandall. To which <hi>Paulucci</hi> anſwered, that he hoped his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi> would take order for the time to come, that none ſhould giue him any occaſion. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>Inquiſitor</hi> gaue him to vnderſtand, that, not as <hi>Inquiſitor,</hi> but as his friend, he deſired to ſpeake with him in ſome priuate houſe. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that before this difficulty he was ſtil rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſpeake with him as a particular Friend, but now he could not, and he would not doe it.</p>
            <p>But to returne to the treaty of Peace, which ſtill continued, not withſtanding that either part defended their Reaſons by writing: in the end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> was made a greater ouerture to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, which almoſt gaue perfection vnto the Treaty, although afterwards many Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations paſſed without effect. On the ſeuenteenth of <hi>Auguſt, Mounſieur de Freſne</hi> came to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> with <hi>Letters</hi> from the <hi>King</hi> of the fourth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> wherein he teſtified his great diſpleaſure for the Differences betweene the
<hi>Pope</hi> and the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:17285:121"/> 
               <hi>Republique,</hi> fearing the miſchiefes which might enſue: that in regard of the place which he held in <hi>Chriſt endome,</hi> for his Deuotion to the <hi>See A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolique,</hi> and for the Amity which he had with the <hi>Republique,</hi> he was moued to interpoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, deſiring to finde ſome honeſt Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but that he ſhould be hindered to execute this his laudable deſigne, if the
<hi>Republique</hi> did not aid him by ſuch meanes as depended vpon them: that he had enioyned <hi>Freſne</hi> his <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi> to exhort his <hi>Serenity</hi> to continue his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Prudence, and the affection which he had towards <hi>God,</hi> towards <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and towards the <hi>State;</hi> and to aſſure him that his intention aimed meerely at the conſeruation of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the <hi>Republique.</hi> The
<hi>Letter</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing read, <hi>Freſne</hi> made his propoſition, ſaying, that the <hi>King</hi> was diſguſted for that he could not draw from them any thing but generall words in a buſineſſe ſo important, and ſo preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: that he doubted the new inſtance which now he made with ſincerity, would bring diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, and be interpreted to other ends than he intended; neuertheleſſe being a friend, and obliged to the <hi>Republique,</hi> for that which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they had done in his behalfe, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:17285:121"/> their courteſies, as alſo fore-ſeeing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences which might fall out, he was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for this quarrell, and had interpoſed himſelfe (not being deſired,) to ſtay theſe euils, which doubtleſſe would increaſe, if the <hi>Repub.</hi> would not aide him: that the <hi>Pope</hi> had condeſcended to honeſt Conditions, and ſuch, as he ſeemed not to demand any thing contrary to the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and Liberty of the <hi>Republique;</hi> that the <hi>King</hi> would be diſpleaſed, if (the <hi>Pope</hi> hauing iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his Cauſe to the World in ſome ſort, though in effect all iudged for the <hi>Repub.)</hi> they ſhould reſiſt the Motions of al <hi>Chriſtian Princes,</hi> in which caſe he could not fauour them: as otherwiſe he was purpoſed to doe, if the <hi>Pope</hi> againſt all iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice would force their Libertie, and endamage their Gouernment, for then he would employ all his Forces, all his Armes, and his <hi>Eſtates</hi> for the Seruice of his <hi>Serenity. Freſne</hi> added fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that His <hi>Maieſty</hi> was ſo much diſpleaſed for that he could not draw from the <hi>Republique</hi> any particular Intenſion in this buſineſſe, that Hee was minded once to reſt himſelfe and to meddle no more; but yet he had reſolued to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard one Triall more, and to make one Reply, praying the <hi>Senate</hi> for his ſake to be confident in
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:17285:122"/> him, as in their Friend, and ſo farre as they might to yeeld, and giue ſome ſatisfaction vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> aſſuring them that his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> would reſt content with a little, if by any meanes he might ſaue his Reputation. And thereupon the
<hi>Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador</hi> propoſed two things: The one was, that the
<hi>Senate</hi> would ſuſpend the Execution of the Lawes, and the Proteſtation publiſhed againſt the <hi>Monitory</hi> of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> vpon condition that his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> would doe as much with his <hi>Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> and with the Cenſures, for foure or ſix mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, during which time they might treat of the Merit of the Lawes that were queſtioned. And here he ſhe that the Suſpenſion of the Laws was a thing that might be eaſily yeelded; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lawes being Prohibitiue, the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation whereof conſiſted in not doing that which they forbad, a Suſpenſion of them could not bring any innouation. But for the Suſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Proteſtation, he did not deſire that it might be done in ſuch paſſages, wherein the actions of the <hi>Republique</hi> were proued iuſt, and conſequently the Cenſures pronounced void and inualide, but only in ſuch clauſes wherein they ſeemed to breake off friendſhip with <hi>Pope:</hi> that if this manner did not intirely ſatisfie, ſome
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:17285:122"/> other more conuenient might be deuiſed, the thing in it ſelfe being honeſt, the queſtion only of words: that if the terme of ſix moneths for the Suſpenſion of the <hi>Monitory</hi> did not ſeeme ſufficient, the <hi>Pope</hi> might be eaſily induced to prolong it. Another thing propoſed, was, that the Priſoners might be rendered without preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the Cauſe of the <hi>Republique;</hi> that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious gone out of <hi>Venice,</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict,</hi> might returne, and the <hi>Pope</hi> would Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the <hi>Monitory</hi> for ſome time. But the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador</hi> paſſed lightly ouer this Propoſition, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That it was not the Intention of the <hi>King,</hi> that any thing ſhould be done againſt the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie or to the diſaduantage of the <hi>Repub.</hi> and that if either of theſe Propoſitions were to their preiudice, he was content to let them paſſe in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; that he had propoſed them not thinking them preiudicial, but if they ſhewed the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, he had done. He deſired them further to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that it was neceſſary to giue ſome apparent Occaſion vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> that he might retract, becauſe it was neuer heard that a
<hi>Pope</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked his <hi>Bulles,</hi> excepting at
<hi>Conſtance</hi> by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>Councell;</hi> that if it ſeemed indecent and againſt the Cuſtome of the <hi>Republique</hi> to
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:17285:123"/> correct their Lawes at the inſtance of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> or to render Priſoners vpon his demand, for theſe things might be found ſome temper, ſo as the things aforeſaid might be done at the requeſt of the <hi>King,</hi> and to gratifie Him, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any mention of the <hi>Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Senate</hi> this Matter was put in Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; where, after they had well examined all the Reaſons, and conſidered withall the Perils which followed vpon the continuation of theſe Differences, they preferred with one ioynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, before all other reſpects, the preſeruation of their Liberty, which without doubt had beene violated, if the
<hi>Senate</hi> had beene conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnder any pretext to take away the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their Lawes. For the point of giuing vp the Priſoners in gratification to the <hi>King,</hi> they thought this not to touch vpon their Liberty, although they ſaw it was deſired to giue ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction vnto the
<hi>Pope;</hi> in as much as it was a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular fact which drew not with it any conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that the like ought to be done in times to come. And here there were two opinions; ſome propoſed that onely One of the ſhould be rendered, others were of aduice that they ſhould render Both. And this opinion preuailed, becauſe
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:17285:123"/> if the one were releaſed, the deliuerance of the other (the caſe being like) could not be well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed; and beſides, if the <hi>Senate</hi> at firſt ſhould not yeeld ſo farre as they might, by this meanes a gate might be open to other preiudiciall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; but if they ſhould conſent ſo farre as was poſſible, they ſhould be freed from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie of new Propoſitions, and the <hi>King</hi> Obliged to turne himſelfe vpon the <hi>Pope.</hi> They alſo conſidered that by yeelding one Priſoner to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> they ſhould inuite ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Prince</hi> to demand the other, which if they refuſed, he would reſt ill ſatisfied; and if they granted him, the moſt
<hi>Chriſtian King</hi> would iudge the fauour done to him to be but ſmall. So then reſoluing to yeeld the two Priſoners vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>King,</hi> the
<hi>Senate</hi> anſwered to the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the
<hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> thanking his <hi>Maiesty</hi> for his mediation, and adioyned, that as the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> tooke in good part all that was done by his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> ſo they prayed him not to interpret a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe that they had not condeſcended to any Particularity, in as much as they knew not what to ſay in ſuch a difficulty, offered againſt all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and aboue beleefe, contrary to the Libertie and Gouernment of their
<hi>Eſtate,</hi> which they
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:17285:124"/> were aſſured (and it was certaine) his
<hi>Maieſtie</hi> would not preiudice. That it was eaſie to ſee whereat aimed the Deſignes of the <hi>Pope,</hi> who, ſeeing that the Iuſtice of the <hi>Repub.</hi> for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and ground of the Cauſe, was knowne and confeſſed by all, not only out of <hi>Italy,</hi> but euen in
<hi>Rome,</hi> would therefore to take aduantage find diſorder in the forme and maner of proceeding; wherein the Iuſtice of the <hi>Republique</hi> was ſo cleare, that it was manifeſt to all, the Errours of the <hi>Pope</hi> ſo groſſe, that they could not be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Wherefore, that it was not iuſt to correct the Faults of another with their owne damage and diſhonour, and ſince others had cauſed theſe Diſorders, it was not for the
<hi>Senate</hi> to remedie them: they had done ſufficiently, in that hauing receiued inſupportable Iniuries, they had procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with exemplary moderation, doing nothing herein but for their neceſſary defence. That the Queſtions moued by the <hi>Pope</hi> in the beginning of theſe differences were very vnreaſonable, but that which was done after was intolerable, the
<hi>Republique</hi> being aſſaulted by Treacheries, and practiſes of Sedition to moue the people, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it ſelfe (which is moſt of all) being by theſe meanes endangerd: that yet ſtill they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:17285:124"/> by the <hi>Pope;</hi> who vnder pretence of propoſitions and ſatisfactions of forme ſought to iuſtifie his Cauſe. That the <hi>Repub.</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this was ready to doe what they might, their Liberty remaining entire, but they could not conſent that it ſhould be diminiſhed in any faſhion, without the high offence of God: That to ſuſpend their Lawes was nothing elſe but to confeſſe a want of authority to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine them, which in effect was to cut the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes of Gouernment: conſidering that the queſtion was not onely of theſe Lawes, but of all others, as alſo of their Authority to rule and gouerne their
<hi>State,</hi> which muſt needs be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded if they grant the <hi>Pope</hi> a power by his Cenſures to conſtraine them to a ſuſpenſion; a thing pernicious to the Liberty not only of the <hi>Repub:</hi> but of all ſoueraigne <hi>Princes</hi> who muſt neceſſarily reſt depriued of al Soueraignty when they ſubmit themſelues vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> who ſhall haue power by his Excommunications to force them to regulate their Lawes and Ordinances after his will. And that pretext of <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> Liberty will bring forth this effect, that no Law ſhall be exempt from the Cenſure of the <hi>Pope,</hi> ſeeing he attributeth to himſelfe Authority

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:17285:125"/> to define and determine, euen againſt the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of al the World, what Lawes are iuſt or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt. That though the Lawes were prohibitiue, yet it followed not they might be ſuſpended without preiudice, ſince if the prohibitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were taken a way, men had Liberty to do the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, and euery ſuſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſion implies a want either of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or of wiſedome, &amp; eſpecially to do it for feare or at the threatning of another neceſſarily inferred a Subiection. That the <hi>Repub.</hi> receiued willingly the word of the <hi>King,</hi> to wit, that hee would doe nothing which might turne to their preiudice, and thereupon deſired to be excuſed if they did not condeſcend to this particular: that they had not propoſed any thing to his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> as looking that the remedy ſhould come whence the euill it ſelfe, and all theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders: But now in fauour of his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> they were purpoſed to declare what they could doe if the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould firſt take away the Cenſures, and that to let the <hi>King</hi> ſee what inclination they had to Concord, and how willing they were to doe for his ſake what was poſſible, (a fauour not to be yeelded to any other whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,) which was in ſumme and in particular, that when the <hi>King</hi> ſhould be aſſured and haue
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:17285:125"/> the firme word of the <hi>Pope,</hi> that he would to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally take away the Cenſures, and put an end to all theſe Controuerſies: the <hi>Repub.</hi> in gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to his
<hi>Maieſtie,</hi> would render him the two Priſoners, although they were guilty of great crimes, and would take away their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, ſauing yet ſtill their publique Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and their Power to iudge the
<hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtiques,</hi> when it ſhould be expedient for the
<hi>State.</hi> In conformity of this, the <hi>Senate</hi> alſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Letter of the <hi>King,</hi> and gaue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their <hi>Ambaſſ. Priuli</hi> to ſpeake vnto him. The <hi>King</hi> thanked them, for that they had done for him what they would not for any other; and ſaid, that he was obliged to the <hi>Repub.</hi> for many good offices which he had receiued from them, and particularly for that they had admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him into the body of their Nobility. And for that which they had done in his fauour, that he would giue order to his <hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> to preſſe the
<hi>Pope</hi> to be therewith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented: but that if he ſhould not conſent, and if nothing remained but a Suſpenſion of their Lawes, he hoped they would herein alſo yeel ſomewhat, ſeeing <hi>Freſne</hi> had written vnto him that the Reaſons which they vrged to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:17285:126"/> were not preſsing. The <hi>Ambaſſ. Priuli</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that they had ſignified all that could be done to
<hi>Freſne,</hi> but happily he had not written all: and further he made remonſtrance to his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> what great preiudice was done to the Authority of a Soueraigne <hi>Prince,</hi> if he were conſtrained to change his Lawes at the pleaſure of another paſsing from one Law to another, or to acknowledge that he borrowes from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all power of Gouerning. Which Diſcourſe being amplified by the <hi>Ambaſſadour,</hi> the
<hi>King</hi> condeſcended to ſay, that he would neuer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the
<hi>Republique</hi> to doe any thing againſt their Liberty, their Dignity, and good Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time when the Anſwer of the <hi>Senate</hi> was ſent into <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> aſſaied to make the <hi>Republique</hi> yeeld to ſome particular, and preſenting himſelfe to the <hi>Duke,</hi> exhorted him to a Compoſition: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that it was neceſſary to grant ſomething to the
<hi>King</hi> his <hi>Maſter,</hi> becauſe if he might cary aſſurance of any ſatisfaction vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> he would caſt himſelfe at his feet, to pray him for an end of theſe Differences, which drew with them ſo great troubles; That the <hi>Pope</hi> was not
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:17285:126"/> contented with all that had formerly beene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and therefore it was needfull to giue him more ample Commiſſion; that it was not ſitting to ſtand vpon ſmall pointills with the <hi>Pope,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Vicar</hi> of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> conſequently it was no ſhame to yeeld vnto him, and ſubmit to his Will; that he would propoſe this ouerture, to wit, that they ſhould make him
<hi>Auogador</hi> for two houres, during which time he would ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually worke, that all the affaires ſhould be accommodated. The <hi>Duke</hi> demanded what he meant by being <hi>Auogador,</hi> and what he would put in execution by meanes of that Charge? He anſwered, that they ſhould firſt put him in that Charge, according to the cuſtome, which being done, he would to good purpoſe vſe his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. And he adioyned, that it was not meet ſubtilly to goe to worke, when men are to Treat with the <hi>Pope,</hi> but only to be very humble, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant in ſatisfactions, ſubmiſſions, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience towards his <hi>Holineſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this Propoſition when the <hi>Senate</hi> deferred ſome daies to anſwer, the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> appeared againe, ſaying that he had very expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements from his <hi>King,</hi> to moue the
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pub.</hi> to giue him ſome occaſion that he might
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:17285:127"/> preſent himſelfe to the <hi>Pope:</hi> that he ſaw well the <hi>Republique</hi> to deſire the agreement no leſſe than the <hi>Pope;</hi> that on both parts there wanted not good will, but all conſiſted in the meanes to execute, which vntill that time neither was able or willing to finde; that in this affaire, as in
<hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe</hi> each one deſired the end, but none would vſe the meanes proper thereunto. When the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> did not anſwer to this Propoſition, no more than to the former, the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> well iudging, that if he preſſed them too much, he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ſome vnpleaſing anſwer, he ſignified vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that if they had not reſolued to yeeld ſomewhat according to his Petition, they ſhould rather deferre their anſwer, than reiect and deny him altogether.</p>
            <p>But ſome daies afterwards, this <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent for touching that which happened at <hi>Durazzo</hi> (whereof we ſpake before,) after they had treated of that buſineſſe, Hee modeſtly complained that as yet they had not anſwered his late Propoſitions, adding yet that he did not demand an anſwer, although it appeared that he deſired it. To which the <hi>Prince</hi> by Decree of the <hi>Senate</hi> formerly made, anſwered, That ſince they could doe no more for the contentment of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:17285:127"/> the <hi>Pope</hi> than they had done, and ſo not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie him by an anſwer, they had reſolued (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his deſire) not to anſwer at all. <hi>D. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigo</hi> replied, I will be then for the preſent <hi>Auoga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> (ſaid he) and I doe Suſpend the Anſwer which the <hi>Senate</hi> hath made me, to the end that they may better aduiſe themſelues, &amp; at length reſolue to Suſpend their Lawes to gratifie my <hi>King,</hi> and not the <hi>Pope.</hi> And he endeuoured to perſwade by many Reaſons, that as a Suſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the inſtance of the <hi>Pope</hi> might bring pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice, ſo it could not be any way preiudiciall to doe it in conſideration of another <hi>Prince;</hi> and for example alledged that his <hi>King,</hi> at the requeſt of the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> Suſpended the <hi>Edict</hi> of thirty for an hundred, and did not eſteeme that it was any diminution to his reputation: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he exhorted them to ballance the Suſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (a light thing) with the incommodities and dangers which might be cauſed by their reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and made inſtance to haue a new anſwer.</p>
            <p>Whileſt they were conſidering this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being ſtill reſolued to yeeld nothing preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall to their Liberty, they receiued aduice how the <hi>Pope</hi> had erected in the beginning of
<hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> a new Congregation at <hi>Rome,</hi> called, <hi>The
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:17285:128"/> Congregation of Warre,</hi> with order that it ſhould be holden twice a week to Treat vpon the point of Warre: which gaue matter of diſcourſe not only in <hi>Rome,</hi> but thorowout
<hi>Italy.</hi> And firſt for the extraordinary Name of the <hi>Congregation of Warre,</hi> it hath beene an ancient Cuſtome of the <hi>Court</hi> of
<hi>Rome,</hi> to couer the managing of Temporall things vnder Colours and Names Spirituall, whereas here on the contrary, the <hi>Pope</hi> being deſtitute of all meanes to make War (though he had deſire enough) made this vaine oſtentation of worldly Power, intitling this <hi>Congregation</hi> with the proud Name of <hi>Warre.</hi> And men maruailed ſo much the more, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the quality of thoſe Men where of this <hi>Congregation</hi> was compoſed, who were all of a Profeſſion vtterly vnexperienced and vnfit for ſuch affaires, fifteene <hi>Cardinalls</hi> being thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to called; in the choiſe whereof the <hi>Pope</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in whom hee placed his greateſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, all being of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction. The names of theſe <hi>Cardinals</hi> were <hi>Como, Pinelli, Sauli, Camerino, Sfondrato, Iuſtinian, S. George, Arrigone, Viſconte, Conti, Burgheſe, Sforza, Montalth, Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi> and <hi>Cefis:</hi> Out of theſe he culled Foure, to wit, <hi>Pinelli, Iuſtinian, S. George,</hi> and
<hi>Cefis,</hi> to be
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:17285:128"/> employed with the <hi>Treaſurer</hi> and the
<hi>Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of the <hi>Chamber,</hi> about the meanes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide money. He alſo Created eight <hi>Cardinalls</hi> in the middle of
<hi>September,</hi> not without the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of godly Perſons, and ſuch as reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Antiquity, becauſe he had not expected the due time of
<hi>Ember,</hi> which followed but a few dayes after. It is true ſometimes the <hi>Popes</hi> vpon ſome vrgent conſideration, had formerly Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one or two, or three <hi>Cardinalls</hi> out of that Time, when it is farre off, but this was obſerued to be the firſt entire Promotion made out of Time, which had been ſeaſonable the next week following. Theſe
<hi>Cardinals</hi> newly Created, were the <hi>Nuntio's</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> to the end that they might employ themſelues more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly in his Seruice, by reaſon of this Honour which they had receiued, and alſo that by this meanes they might haue more credit with thoſe <hi>Princes.</hi> Two others were <hi>Caietan</hi> and
<hi>Spinola,</hi> to ſerue himſelfe of them in the <hi>State Ecclefiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> vpon the Frontiers of the <hi>State</hi> of
<hi>Venice,</hi> as well knowing their humour and diſpoſition; To theſe were ioyned ſoure others, <hi>Lanti, Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> of the <hi>Chamber, Montreal, Maffei,</hi> and <hi>Ferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tini,</hi> by whoſe Promotion fell vacant many
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:17285:129"/> great Offices vendible in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Promotion in no ſort pleaſed the <hi>Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> although this latter had reaſon to be content, for the Intereſts of his <hi>King;</hi> ſince of this whole number of eight, there were at the leaſt Six well affected to that <hi>Crowne.</hi> But that which diſpleaſed the <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> was that his Brother had beene neglected, as alſo He of <hi>France</hi> was not well ſatisfied, becauſe they had not thought vpon <hi>Villeroy</hi> his Father.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Holineſſe</hi> rendered an account of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion vnto the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> by his <hi>Nuntio,</hi> and on this occaſion made new inſtances to that <hi>King</hi> to be aided againſt the
<hi>Republique,</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting in a violent faſhion (according to his cuſtome) the matters treated by <hi>Freſne,</hi> who ſaid (as he fained) that at <hi>Venice</hi> the Authority of the <hi>Catholique King</hi> was deſpiſed, and ſo did him no benefit: for the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> (who yet was his Friend, and employed himſelfe for him effectually) would take the contrary ſide, if he ſaw him thus ioyned with
<hi>Spaine.</hi> But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were too well aduiſed to be ſwayed by ſuch feeble Reaſons.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Venice,</hi> by reaſon of this <hi>Congregation</hi> which the <hi>Pope</hi> had erected, the <hi>Senate</hi> now
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:17285:129"/> clearely made anſwer to <hi>Cardenas</hi> the <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> of <hi>Spaine;</hi> that it was Notorious to all the World, that the <hi>Republique</hi> could not alter their Lawes in any ſort, without great detriment to their <hi>Eſtate;</hi> that it ſeemed ſtrange to them why they ſhould addreſſe themſelues vnto the
<hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> only, and make Propoſitions ſo preiudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, whileſt on the other ſide they fomented the pretenſions of the
<hi>Pope:</hi> that if their end were the repoſe of <hi>Italy</hi> and of
<hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> they might clearely ſee the good affection of the
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi> to that purpoſe, and that the contrary ſignes appeared manifeſtly in the <hi>Pope:</hi> that the moſt apparent was the
<hi>Congregation</hi> newly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for Warre, by which it was euident where at they aimed, and that by the quality of them which he had elected, he had ſhewed ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where he grounded his hopes. The <hi>Senate</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo proteſted that they had no other end or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſaue only to defend themſelues, in which regard if they came to Armes, the Cauſe ſhould proceed meerely from the <hi>Pope:</hi> Wherefore if the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> deſired the Peace, that he ſhould labour with the
<hi>Pope,</hi> from whom aroſe the beginning and progreſſe of all theſe Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. They commended likewiſe the good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:17285:130"/> done by the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> for quietneſſe, to which end if others elſe-where had employed themſelues with like intention and dexteritie, things had not gone ſo farre; noting hereby the <hi>Marquis de Villena,</hi> of whom they were aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed euen from <hi>Spaine,</hi> that he did not aime at Peace. They ſent alſo a
<hi>Currier</hi> with diligence to <hi>Francis Priuli</hi> their
<hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> commanding him to ſpeake in like manner to the <hi>King,</hi> and to his <hi>Miniſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame time <hi>Monſieur de Freſne</hi> was called by the
<hi>Senate,</hi> with whom they diſcourſed touching the
<hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation</hi> of War newly erected, and of the <hi>Cardinals</hi> whereof it conſiſted, who were ill affected to the <hi>Republique</hi> and not well to <hi>France;</hi> wherein the <hi>Pope</hi> had teſtified his ſmall reſpect of the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King,</hi> not expecting his anſwer, which they could not aſcribe to any other cauſe but the
<hi>Popes</hi> purpoſe to purſue the Troubles, who was confident in the declaration of <hi>Spaine,</hi> not making account of any other, for the aſſiſtance and forces which he expected from thence. Adioyning, that the
<hi>Senate</hi> would communicate with him in all confidence, as with the
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of a <hi>King</hi> iuſt and their friend: that they were reſolued to
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:17285:130"/> doe what they could in their defence, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the iniuries, promiſing themſelues on the <hi>Kings</hi> part all aſſiſtance for the common Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. The <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> complained of this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,</hi> and of the qualitie of thoſe that were elected, as alſo for that the <hi>Pope</hi> had not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the anſwer of the <hi>King</hi> as he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And becauſe he had then receiued anſwer from the <hi>King</hi> concerning that which the
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi> had yeelded in gratification to his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie,</hi> he gaue them thanks for the Priſoners, and for the other things which they had promiſed: yet he ſignified that there remained ſome doubt in the
<hi>King</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> would hardly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to reuoke his
<hi>Cenſures</hi> before the Suſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Lawes, ſeeing the Lawes had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen occaſion to the Publication of the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures;</hi> that his
<hi>Maieſtie</hi> had conſidered the Reaſons of the <hi>Republique</hi> and approued them, and that hee would ſerue himſelfe thereof in time and place, although he would not conteſt with the <hi>Pope;</hi> who hauing caſt himſelfe into a precipice by euill counſell, yet would not ſee the meanes to recouer himſelfe, and therefore often recalled the word which he had once gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and all delay put him in doubt and ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:17285:131"/> Wherefore he exhorted them ſpeedily to put an end vnto the Difference, which could not be done without ſuſpending the execution of their Lawes, alledging for reaſon that this was nothing but a pure ceremonie, &amp; ſhould be done in gratificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the <hi>King,</hi> not of the <hi>Pope:</hi> That it ſhould be done to no other end, then to giue ſome pretext vnto the <hi>Pope</hi> to retire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with honour; and that haply in ſo doing there ſhould be no ſpeech of the Priſoners nor the Proteſtation: That the <hi>King</hi> in all this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted he deſired not any whit to preiudice their Liberty and their Eſtate, as hauing for end only the common good: That hereby they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his intentions to differ from theirs who had requeſted the <hi>Pope</hi> to ſuffer no Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſition but by their meanes, the end whereof was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume both the one part &amp; the other. <hi>Freſne</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned, that when they ſhould bee forced to make Warre, the <hi>King</hi> would readily ſerue the
<hi>Republique,</hi> if they would communicate with him their Deſignes as well offenſiue as defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue. Hee demanded alſo aſſurance, that they would not treat of the Accord but by his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, and by no other meanes, becauſe the <hi>King</hi> was not yet certaine that the <hi>Pope</hi> would
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:17285:131"/> caſt himſelfe into the armes of
<hi>Spaine:</hi> But if he ſhould ſee him reſolued to breake, he knew well how to reſtraine his furie, which he would doe principally for the fauour and good intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence which hee had with the <hi>Republique;</hi> though if he had not ſo ſtrict an alliance with them, yet he was obliged by reaſon of <hi>State</hi> to aſſiſt them, and oppoſe himſelfe againſt their ruine. Vpon this the <hi>Senate</hi> thought it conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, to procure a confirmation of all this from the <hi>Kings</hi> owne mouth, and therefore comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their <hi>Ambaſſador Reſident</hi> with him to doe all that he could to diſcouer the minde of his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> and to draw from him this confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; intreating him that ſince the <hi>Pope</hi> relying vpon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and others, did not ceaſe to Arme, and becauſe the times required, his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie</hi> would be contented to vſe his authoritie to ſtop the courſe of theſe euils, which if they ſhould continue, the <hi>Republique</hi> could not but haue recourſe to their true, ancient and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Friends, among whom he was the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall. And when it ſhould pleaſe him confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to communicate with them his intentions, they would ſend vnto his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> a Perſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly to treat of particularities. To this the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:17285:132"/> 
               <hi>King</hi> anſwered, that hee had beene deſired by the <hi>Nuntio</hi> in the name of the <hi>Pope,</hi> to declare himſelfe for his <hi>Holineſſe;</hi> that he would anſwer them in like manner as he had anſwered the <hi>Pope,</hi> to wit, that to declare himſelfe for either partie wereto foment the Differences, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would not fauour the purpoſes of the one ſide or the other, as did the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> for their owne aduantage, but if they ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe the publique tranquillitie, in that caſe he would doe what beſeemed him, and as any one might coniecture: but for the preſent they ought not to preſſe ſuch Declarations, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtudie to preuent a rupture for to auoid the incommodities of War, which none can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend but they that haue tried them, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſidering the danger of Religion which Warre importeth. That for theſe reaſons it was fit to vſe all meanes not to interrupt the Treaty, nor to render him incapable to conclude the agreement, as he ſhould be if he declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for the one or the other: that to ſend vnto him an expreſſe <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> was to render him ſuſpected vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> and to giue occaſion to the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> to fill his minde with euill im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:17285:132"/> Further, they communicated to the
<hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> of <hi>England, Reſident</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the <hi>Pope</hi> made at <hi>Rome,</hi> and told him, that he might now publiſh the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>King</hi> his
<hi>Maſter,</hi> and procure the Succours which he promiſed; accordingly they gaue order to their <hi>Ambaſſador Iustinian</hi> to treat with the
<hi>King.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh Ambaſſador</hi> teſtified very much contentment to doe this Office, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that it was to publiſh the glory of his <hi>King,</hi> which he would doe not onely in <hi>Venice</hi> to all the Miniſters of <hi>Princes,</hi> but alſo that by his <hi>Letters</hi> he would diuulge the fame thereof thorowout the world. He alſo praied them to ſignifie vnto him their particular Deſignes, for that the <hi>King,</hi> Himſelfe, and other Miniſters of his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> in all places would doe their vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt in their behalfe, and ſhew their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and open heart. He paſſed further, and ſaid, that it was neceſſarie to put a ſpeedy end to this affaire, which could not be attained but by one of theſe three meanes, either by yeelding, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the matter to
<hi>Princes,</hi> or by Warre. That he ſaw well the <hi>Republique</hi> had no minde to the firſt; and if they reſolued to make a refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to any, they could not make choiſe of any
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:17285:133"/> fitter then his <hi>King,</hi> who maruellouſly well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood how much it imported to maintaine the Authoritie giuen by <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Princes.</hi> But if the matter ſhould come to Armes, he praied his <hi>Serenitie</hi> to conſider that though <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſay, the <hi>Sunne</hi> warmes theſe inferiour bodies without heat in it ſelfe, yet in humane things it is not ſo; but he that would heat others in his fauour muſt firſt be hot himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, the <hi>Senate</hi> determined to ſignifie vnto all
<hi>Princes</hi> the Declaration of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> But the <hi>King</hi> vpon the Repreſentation of the <hi>Ambaſſador Iuſtinian,</hi> anſwered, That he called <hi>God</hi> to witneſſe, his reſolution to defend the Cauſe of the <hi>Republique,</hi> had no other end but the Seruice of <hi>God,</hi> and to conſerue the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty giuen by
<hi>God</hi> to all <hi>Princes,</hi> and not for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny euill will which he carried to the <hi>Pope,</hi> being not moued by the particular Intereſt of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique,</hi> but only ſo farre as he knew they defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a Cauſe moſt iuſt and acceptable to <hi>God:</hi> which the more he conſidered in his minde, ſo much the more was he confirmed in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and Defence, not finding any apparant ſhadow of Reaſon to relinquiſh them: that He had readily taken this reſolution, and would
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:17285:133"/> ſuſtaine it conſtantly; that He would not doe as the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who by a <hi>Letter</hi> had filled the
<hi>Popes</hi> Spirit with Vanity, to cary Him into a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice, but that He would execute with courage and ſinceritie what He had promiſed. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered alſo as a thing of great importance, that the <hi>Pope</hi> prepared himſelfe for the Warre, and had to this effect erected a
<hi>Congregation</hi> of men Diſaffected to the <hi>Republique,</hi> and Dependents of <hi>Spaine.</hi> To which He added, that he would be as ready to performe his Promiſe, as to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh his Declaration; and if it might turne to the good of the <hi>Republique,</hi> He would doe it with all poſſible Aduantage, doing alſo good Offices in their behalfe, with all
<hi>Princes</hi> his Friends and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; as with the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>Denmarke,</hi> and the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> from whom he hoped to draw ſome Succour. For the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> and the
<hi>Arch-Duke,</hi> he ſaid it was to no purpoſe to ſpeak vnto them, ſeeing that the Former had declared himſelfe for the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the Latter depended vpon the former: that for <hi>France</hi> it was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, becauſe <hi>Spaine</hi> being for the <hi>Pope,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houed that <hi>King</hi> more than others to conſider it, and to foreſee the enterpriſes which might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue againſt his <hi>Kingdome,</hi> ſo as formerly he had
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:17285:134"/> experience: that if he beleeued the Defence of the <hi>Church</hi> to appertaine vnto him, by reaſon of his Title of
<hi>Moſt Chriſtian,</hi> he might well know that the <hi>Church</hi> herein was not endangered, but the Cauſe in common touched the Libertie of
<hi>Princes,</hi> by whom the <hi>Church</hi> was to be Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and Maintained. For concluſion, He ſaid, that Hee would doe more by effects than in words. And accordingly he executed all that he had promiſed, Signifying by the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury</hi> vnto the
<hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> which were with him, the reſolution which he had taken to Aſſiſt the <hi>Republique,</hi> and writing alſo as much vnto the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> and other his Friends.</p>
            <p>Whileſt theſe things were thus treated with <hi>Kings,</hi> and by them with the <hi>Pope,</hi> the great <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> iudged that it would be an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on worthy of his great Experience, if he aſſayed to finiſh that which was ſo difficult to two ſo great
<hi>Kings.</hi> Wherefore euery weeke almoſt he ſpake thereof to <hi>Robert Lio,</hi> Reſident with him; and cauſed his Reſident <hi>Montagu</hi> in like manner to ſpeake at <hi>Venice,</hi> exhorting them to Peace and Concord for the good of <hi>Italy,</hi> and offering himſelfe to become the
<hi>Mediator.</hi> To
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:17285:134"/> which they alwaies anſwered with thankes, and with this concluſion, that he ſhould addreſſe himſelfe rather to the <hi>Pope,</hi> ſince the <hi>Republique</hi> had ſo farre condeſcended, that the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> had thanked them. But the great <hi>Duke</hi> was not content with this Anſwer, which gaue no occaſion for him to draw the affaire to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and therefore he complained with great dexteritie, that he had profitably imployed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe both with the <hi>Pope,</hi> and with the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> without any correſpondence on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe: on the contrary, that on both ſides he had receiued ſuch words, which if hee had repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they had beene ſufficient to trouble all the affaire, and to cut off hope of a Concluſion. That his meaning was not to giue counſell vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Senate,</hi> knowing well their prudence, much leſſe to enterpriſe to Treat with the preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of other greater <hi>Princes,</hi> but to ioyne with them for the Seruice of <hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſtendome:</hi> That he would therefore aduertiſe the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> of all that the <hi>Pope</hi> had ſaid in the laſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> which was, that his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> could not, nor would conſent vnto the Conditions propoſed by the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> in as much as it ſhould be to him a
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:17285:135"/> great preiudice to receiue the
<hi>Republique</hi> to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour by the hands of any <hi>King,</hi> being himſelfe the Spirituall Head of the <hi>Church,</hi> to whom it is not ſitting to receiue his Subiects at the hand of another: and ſo much the more, becauſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in any difficult betweene the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Court</hi> and the <hi>Secular,</hi> the Iudgement thereof pertaineth to the
<hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> as to the more worthy. That the <hi>Pope</hi> further ſaid, that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Priſoners by the hands of the
<hi>King,</hi> was to goe backward, becauſe ſome <hi>Venetian Prelats</hi> which were then at <hi>Rome,</hi> had aſſured him that the
<hi>Republique</hi> would willingly deliuer them to himſelfe; That therfore he was reſolued not to Suſpend the Excommunication before the Priſoners were deliuered, and the Writings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked which had beene publiſhed in fauour of the <hi>Republique:</hi> that afterwards hee would be content the Differences remaining might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined at <hi>Rome</hi> by a
<hi>Congregation</hi> of <hi>Cardinalls, Auditors,</hi> and <hi>Diuines,</hi> whereof a part might be the Confidents of the <hi>Republique,</hi> vpon Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion notwithſtanding that the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and the great <hi>Duke</hi> would paſſe their word, that they would ſtand to that which was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by this <hi>Congregation:</hi> that although he had
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:17285:135"/> formerly condeſcended to an Accord by a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall Suſpenſion, of his <hi>Monitory,</hi> and of the Lawes of the
<hi>Republique,</hi> yet he could not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute this Accord, becauſe it was not approued by the <hi>Cardinalls;</hi> That the <hi>Moſt Chriſtian King</hi> had ſignified vnto him, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> ought to accept this Condition, but for himſelfe, he was not obliged: That if the
<hi>Venetians</hi> had the aid of <hi>Heretiques,</hi> he would haue on his part more <hi>Chriſtians</hi> than men beleeued. That the great <hi>Duke</hi> ſignified theſe particularities to the <hi>Republique,</hi> to let them ſee that there could be no worſe reſolution than that which enclined them to Warre againſt the <hi>Pope,</hi> which muſt needs be to their damage; for as much as whoſoeuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends in that kinde with him may loſe much, but gaine nothing which it ſhall not be meet doubly to reſtore. That Warre is profitable to none, eſpecially not to them who finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in good eſtate, ſeeing it produces alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and eaſily men paſſe therein from better to worſe with little hope of returning. That if the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> treated in this Buſineſſe with great zeale for the good of the <hi>Republique,</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe would not be inferiour to him in a good deſire to procure the ſame, being their Friend,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:17285:136"/> an <hi>Italian Prince,</hi> and a good man: That they ought not to doubt, but if the Warre proceeded, the <hi>Pope</hi> would be aſſiſted by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and others; and therefore to auoid the Troubles of <hi>Italy,</hi> which might follow, he would perſwade the <hi>Pope</hi> to be contented that all Differences might be referred to the iudgement of the Two <hi>Kings,</hi> and deſired the <hi>Republique</hi> to doe the ſame; yea that he would counſell them to doe this, not expecting the <hi>Popes</hi> aſſent, conſidering that ſince it was certaine the
<hi>Pope</hi> would not conſent to this motion, becauſe it was to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelfe to the iudgement of another, the <hi>Republique</hi> hereby might gaine ſome aduantage by putting the <hi>Pope</hi> in diffidence with theſe
<hi>Kings,</hi> and by taking away the courage of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for his aſſiſtance. And although the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould conſent, yet the <hi>Republique</hi> might be aſſured, that the <hi>Kings</hi> in the deciſion would haue reſpect to their owne Intereſts, which were the ſame with thoſe of the <hi>Republique.</hi> That of this Propoſition were not admitted, then be had another peraduenture ſome what more difficult, but which would certainly better ſucceed, if they would make ſome ſmall Expences; which it behoued them not to reiect, for as much
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:17285:136"/> as a ſeaſonable Expence is ordinarily very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall. That hee knew well what hee ſaid, hauing a great Friend in
<hi>Court,</hi> the <hi>Lord Iohn Baptiſt Borgheſe,</hi> the <hi>Popes</hi> Brother; that if they would giue way, with a little ſiluer hee would aſſuredly bring the Controuerſie to a good agreement. To theſe Propoſuious the <hi>Senate</hi> anſwered, after they had thanked the great
<hi>Duke</hi> for the communication of all that which he knew from
<hi>Rome,</hi> as alſo for his good Offices, Counſels and Diſcourſes; that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the <hi>Republique</hi> to Peace was knowne to all the World, in which they purpoſed ſtill to continue, prouided that they were not conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to doe otherwiſe: alſo they had giuen hereof good Teſtimony, ſeeing that not hauing no regard to Offences receiued, &amp; to the iuſtice of their Cauſe, which required that Iniuries ſhould be thorowly repaied, before they gaue care to any Conditions of Peace; they had not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding not only kept open the way vnto The Treaty, and harkned to the Propoſitions which had beene made, but had further yeelded ſo far as they were able at the inſtance of the Two <hi>Kings.</hi> And although they had done ſo much, and that the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> was not
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:17285:137"/> onely fully ſatisfied touching their actions, but had alſo ſent expreſly to thanke them, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe they could not yet ſee any effect of the Treaty of that
<hi>King</hi> with the <hi>Pope;</hi> and therefore the <hi>Republique</hi> was obliged to ſtand to that which they had treated with the <hi>King,</hi> and expected what his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> would doe in the buſineſſe, iudging it not fit to interrupt the treaty which hee had enterpriſed: but in the meane while, that they would ſay confidently, there were many and vnauoidable difficulties in thoſe things which the <hi>Pope</hi> had ſignified vnto him by his <hi>Ambaſſador.</hi> For touching the point of the
<hi>Priſoners,</hi> hauing giuen them vnto the <hi>King,</hi> they had no more to doe in them, nor was it in them now to take any other reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And for that which concerned the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> being firſt publiſhed, and full of iniuries, reuilings and calumnies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they were of neceſſity to make anſwer with modeſtie, it was not meet to vrge them, if they did not firſt of all, or at leaſt at the ſame time, vrge againſt thoſe of <hi>Rome.</hi> For the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi> to which the <hi>Pope</hi> would remit the affaire, it was not needfull to ſay much, the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi> being not accuſtomed to refer vnto the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:17285:137"/> deciſion of another, ſuch things as coucerne their Gouernment. And for the other Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of his
<hi>Highneſſe,</hi> ſince that the <hi>Popes</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of proceeding gaue iuſt ſuſpition that he was not diſpoſed vnto Peace, they could not examine them, vnleſſe they had greater certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his intentions: and ſeeing all former Treaties had produced no good effect, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the <hi>Popes</hi> inconſtancie well knowne to his
<hi>Highneſſe,</hi> the <hi>Republique</hi> ſaw clearely it was to no purpoſe to harken to any further propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, or to oblige themſelues by their word in any points without a reciprocall aſſurance on his behalfe. But when (after the remouing of the <hi>Cenſures)</hi> they ſhould ſee any appearance of an amicable temperame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which might efface the iuſt apprehenſions which they had of his ordinarie inconſtancie, they would conſider thereof aduiſedly, and end all with reſolution; that which could not be done ſo long as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were handled by diſcourſe. To this anſwer made by the <hi>Reſident</hi> in the name of the <hi>Senate,</hi> the great <hi>Duke</hi> replied, that the <hi>Pope</hi> was not ill affected, although haply ſome accidents had troubled him, which he could affirme out of his certaine knowledge: and that although he
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:17285:138"/> ſeemed to be altered, yet when his
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> did repreſent vnto him the things aforeſaid, he confirmed them; and he adioyned, that he had cauſed many Propoſitions to be made to the <hi>Republique,</hi> and yet could not preuaile to know their intentions: That it was meet to vnderſtand the one the other; That treaties prepare the way to concluſions, and that if they ſhould truſt him with any thing he would make vſe thereof to the aduantage of the
<hi>Republique,</hi> his purpoſe being not to diſcouer all at once vnto the
<hi>Pope</hi> which he had to tell him, but to reſerue a part to ſerue himſelfe thereof as occaſion required, not meaning to doe as others, who had not drawne from the <hi>Pope</hi> any reſolution, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had propoſed many things to his aduantage.</p>
            <p>The interpoſing of ſo many <hi>Princes</hi> for the according of theſe Differences, moued alſo the <hi>Emperour</hi> to haue his part therein: and to this effect, he ſent in the beginning of <hi>October</hi> his
<hi>Vice-Chancelor</hi> named <hi>Coraducci,</hi> to the
<hi>Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador</hi> of the <hi>Repub. Soranzo, Reſident</hi> with him, for to tell him, that his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> vnderſtanding that the Differences betweene the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Republique</hi> were ſo far paſſed, that the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:17285:138"/> thereof was very difficult, eſpecially ſince the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> ſeemed ready to forſake the Treaty, Himſelfe was once purpoſed for the good of <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> (which he paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſired,) to employ himſelfe for the ſetling of a Peace betweene the two parties, if he had thought that his trauell herein would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and that he might performe it with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: but ſince both of them were ſo reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute not to yeeld any thing the one to the other, he could not hazard therein his dignity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. <hi>Soranzo</hi> anſwered, after he had thanked his <hi>Maieſtie;</hi> that the
<hi>Republique</hi> was ready to doe all they could poſſibly to preuent the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the publique Tranquillitie, ſauing euer their Liberty, their Dignity, and the Intereſts of their <hi>Eſtate:</hi> but that the
<hi>Pope</hi> would needs carry all, and pretended that all ought to yeeld vnto his Will without any demurre or conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation. The <hi>Vice-Chancellor,</hi> after ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes vpon the Points, replied, that the
<hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> would not demand any thing of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi> which might be againſt their Honour, and that he would ſend the
<hi>Marquiſe</hi> of <hi>Caſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> with good inſtructions. After this the <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> did
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:17285:139"/> all they could to cauſe the <hi>Emp.</hi> to decalre him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for the <hi>Pope;</hi> to whom the <hi>Emperor</hi> freely anſwered, That He thought not fit to declare himſelfe for either part, or to make ſuch offers as ſome had made by Letters and other ſuch Apparences, this tending to countenance and incourage very exorbitant Pretenſions; That He wiſhed Peace might be eſtabliſhed in any caſe, and being reſolued to bend himſelfe this way, he would not do a thing whereby Peace might be hindered. And in priuate, he gaue the <hi>Ambaſs.</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> to vnderſtand, that for the publique quiet of
<hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> his Maſter ought to mortifie in ſome ſort the <hi>Pope,</hi> to the end that being reduced to Reaſon, hee might more eaſily admit the Peace. Theſe things when the <hi>Ambaſſador Soranzo</hi> had writ to <hi>Venice,</hi> he had charge to thanke the
<hi>Emp.</hi> and to certifie him of their inclination to Peace, and further to tell Him, that the <hi>Senate</hi> would eſteeme it a great Honour, if his
<hi>Maieſtie</hi> would be pleaſed to induce the <hi>Pope</hi> to content himſelfe with thoſe offers which they had made by the means and in conſideration of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE time was thus ſpent in Treaties, vntill the end of
<hi>October,</hi> when the <hi>Pope</hi> began to take into his conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that ſo long as this ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the
<hi>Republique</hi> from his obedience continued, his reputation would be more and more endamaged: becauſe the <hi>Bookes</hi> written in their Defence had opened the eyes of many, and the Liberty of Speech had made knowne the great Defects of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> which formerly many men did not ſo well conſider. Moreouer, hee obſerued by Treating with the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> vpon the particularities of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours which they had promiſed, that the Effects were not anſwerable to their Words, ſince they propoſed hard Conditions; and further gaue him to vnderſtand, that it did not agree with the Piety of the <hi>Catholique King</hi> to be the cauſe of a Warre in <hi>Italy:</hi> wherefore that he was not diſpoſed to ſuccour him but in caſe that hee ſhould be aſſaulted. For theſe cauſes, the
<hi>Pope</hi>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:17285:140"/> reſoluing in himſelfe to ſee an end of this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire hee called <hi>Alincourt</hi> the <hi>Ambaſſ.</hi> of
<hi>France,</hi> to whom hee made a long Diſcourſe, ſhewing that he acknowledged all theſe Diſorders; and repeating the Damages and Preiudices which he ſuffered, with the Dangers to which he was expoſed, he teſtified his great deſire of an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in any ſort, aſſuring him to this effect of his good intention. And foraſmuch as it was not honourable for him to begin the motion, he promiſed to be ready to accept any reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Propoſition.

            <p>
               <hi>Alincourt</hi> hauing communicated theſe things to the
<hi>French Cardinals,</hi> they aduiſed to propoſe vnto the

<hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Senate</hi> in their wiſdome would thinke meet not to make vſe of them, howſoeuer they readily offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. The
<hi>Senate,</hi> when they had maturely conſidered all things, anſwered, that they were
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:17285:141"/> contented the <hi>Pope</hi> might be praied by the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> in the name of the

<hi>Duke</hi> againſt the <hi>Monitorie</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> it ſhould not faile to be retracted when the <hi>Cenſures</hi> were taken away. And for the other Writings the <hi>Republique</hi> would doe with them as the <hi>Pope</hi> with thoſe which had beene made in Fauour of him: That to obſerue the <hi>Interdict</hi> for one onely houre (not to ſpeake of daies) was to confeſſe that it was valide: which being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, they could not doe it without offending <hi>God,</hi> and condemning the Actions of the
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique,</hi> which were but iuſt and lawfull. For the
<hi>Religious,</hi> that this was no point of the Treaty, but onely with his
<hi>Holineſſe</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: That the <hi>Cenſures</hi> being once remoued, they would ſend an <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> to reſide in
<hi>Rome</hi> according to the Cuſtome. But all this vpon condition that the
<hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> would openly let them vnderſtand that they had aſſurance from the <hi>Pope;</hi> becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they did not meane to condeſcend to
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:17285:141"/> any thing, vnleſſe they were aſſured that the <hi>Pope</hi> would accept the Condition. To this <hi>Freſne</hi> replied, that he had not propoſed theſe things if the <hi>Pope</hi> had not firſt giuen his word; but he hath giuen it, ſaid he, and repeated foure times, he hath giuen it: and adioyned, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was true, that
<hi>Popes</hi> ſometime giue themſelues a Licenſe to retract their words, yet he beleeued that this Man would conſtantly keepe his, hauing giuen it. Wherefore he ſaid, that he accepted the Conditions, and took their word, to pray the <hi>Pope</hi> in the Name of the <hi>King</hi> and of the
<hi>Republique,</hi> to take away his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. And in like manner, that they would ſend an <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> who, according as the
<hi>Pope</hi> had promiſed to <hi>Alincourt,</hi> ſhould be receiued with accuſtomed Honour. Adding, that hee would receiue the Priſoners in the Name of the <hi>King,</hi> by way of meere Gratification, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preiudice of the Reaſons of the <hi>Republique;</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> indeed would not make hereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Declaration, but that ſhould reſt vpon the
<hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Popes</hi> Declaration in this caſe was not needfull to the <hi>Republique,</hi> in as much as they Treated not with the
<hi>Pope,</hi> but with the <hi>King.</hi> Concerning the <hi>Religious,</hi> he ſaid: I ſhall
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:17285:142"/> be for them indeed a cold Aduocate, becauſe they cannot deny but they haue committed a great error in diſobeying their
<hi>Prince</hi> contrary to the Commandement of <hi>God,</hi> and ſeeing it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth them eſpecially to Preach Obedience ſo ſtraitly enioyned by
<hi>God.</hi> Beſides that hauing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned their Country, wherin they were wel treated and entertained, their ingratitude herein is ſo intollerable, that if it belonged to me, I ſhould cauſe them to be decimated for example vnto others. He added, That the facility of the <hi>Republique</hi> was very great, in that they conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that their <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> might Treat of their Matter with his <hi>Holineſſe.</hi> And concluded his Diſcourſe, by giuing thankes in the Name of his <hi>King,</hi> for that which they had done to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, aſſuring them that he would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their good diſpoſition to publique. Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie, hauing in truth done as much as was conuenient.</p>
            <p>Whileſt theſe things were thus treated, the <hi>King</hi> of

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:17285:142"/> and alſo with the <hi>Pope,</hi> commanding his <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> to make complaint vnto him, and to ſhew him that he had but little confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his <hi>Holineſſe.</hi> And the
<hi>King</hi> made the ſame complaint vnto <hi>Cardinall Barberino,</hi> the
<hi>Popes Nuntio,</hi> Reſident with him; and by <hi>Freſne</hi> he told them at <hi>Venice,</hi> That he thanked the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> for that they had paſſed their word not to conclude the Affaire by the Mediation of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but of him, although the <hi>Popes</hi> inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie conſtrained him to permit, that his <hi>Serenitie</hi> might endeuour to doe by other meanes what he could. But when <hi>Alincourt</hi> had ſignified vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the
<hi>Pope</hi> the commandement of the <hi>King,</hi> which was, that his
<hi>Maieſtie</hi> had charged him not to meddle further in the Affaire of
<hi>Venice,</hi> ſeeing his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> imagined he could better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate the Buſineſſe by the Mediation of others: the <hi>Pope</hi> who was already aduertiſed by <hi>Letters</hi> from <hi>Cardinall Barberino,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for his anſwer, excuſed himſelfe, that he could not hinder the zeale which ſome Others might haue to determine this buſineſſe, and much leſſe vſe inciuility by refuſing their offers: but that notwithſtanding he had alwaies great confidence in his
<hi>Maieſtie,</hi> and his Deſigne was
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:17285:143"/> that all might be done by his hand: and he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with many oathes often repeated, that his intention was very good, and that he wiſhed the Buſineſſe might be ended that very houre, if it were poſſible, and that not any other beſides the <hi>King</hi> might haue part therein. And to ſhew by effects the truth of that which he ſaid, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned, that he would be content with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions propoſed by his
<hi>Maieſtie,</hi> and would firmely hold the word which he had giuen, to erect a <hi>Congregation</hi> of Six <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Auditors,</hi> among whom he would put the <hi>Cardinals Delfin, Mantica,</hi> and <hi>Seraphin,</hi> and for <hi>Auditors, Cuccina,</hi> and
<hi>Marquemont. Alincourt</hi> here much maruailing, replied, That no ſuch thing had beene formerly ſpoken off: But the <hi>Pope</hi> affirming the contrary, the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly ſaid, That he had not ſo vnderſtood it; and that it was certaine, the <hi>Republique</hi> was reſolued not to referre themſelues to any <hi>Congregation</hi> After many Replies on either Part, the <hi>Pope</hi> was content to giue his word, that no more ſhould be ſpoken of a <hi>Congregation;</hi> and then he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed on the other Conditions, hauing firſt prayed
<hi>Alincourt,</hi> for the loue of <hi>God</hi> to keepe all ſecret, for as much as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> obſerued all
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:17285:143"/> that was treated, to diſturbe it. He promiſed to take away the Cenſures, prouided that in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change the
<hi>Republique</hi> ſhould giue aſſurance to execute theſe Conditions; That the Priſoners ſhould be conſigned into the hands of a
<hi>Prelate,</hi> whom he ſhould name; That an <hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> ſhould come to demand that the Cenſures might be remoued, who ſhould preſent himſelfe with <hi>Alincourt,</hi> with promiſe that he ſhould be well treated and receiued; That on the day appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted they ſhould reuoke the Proteſtation, with all that thereupon had followed; That the
<hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> ſhould be recalled; and that he might haue aſſurance of the <hi>King,</hi> that whileſt the <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> ſhould Treat with him, the Lawes ſhould not be executed: Adding, that whatſoeuer he did herein, was for no other Reaſon, but for the Dignity of the <hi>See Apoſtolique,</hi> &amp; for his charge. And here he inlarged himſelfe with vehement words and geſtures to perſwade theſe Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, adioyning notwithſtanding, that he was not certain whether He could in
<hi>Conſiſtory</hi> draw all the <hi>Cardinals</hi> to his opinion.
<hi>Alincourt</hi> replied, that for the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> to be ſent, no ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition had beene propoſed. The <hi>Pope</hi> ſaid, that otherwiſe he could doe nothing, this tending to
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:17285:144"/> conſerue his reputation, and to ſhew the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of the Excommunication. <hi>Alincourt</hi> made anſwer, that reaſon concluded the contrary, in as much as the receiuing of an
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> with Honour and vſual complements, rather implied the inualidity of the Excommunication. But for all that he could ſay as well vpon this point as others, he could nothing preuaile; for the <hi>Pope</hi> concluded, that thus he ſhould write to <hi>Freſne,</hi> and no otherwiſe. Who reporting theſe words vnto the <hi>Senate,</hi> added, That in this point hee would not perſwade them to one thing or to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but only demanded that he might haue their anſwer.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> immediatly with vehemency com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that in ſtead of approaching to an end by theſe Treaties, things were further off, the Differences being imbittered by this alteration of minds: ſince that the
<hi>Pope</hi> being not willing to hold his word, which he had giuen, this was openly to declare that he would either do thus, or carry all; That it was little for the credit of ſo great a <hi>King,</hi> to intermeddle in this Affaire, ſince the word once giuen him was reuoked: Wherefore that it was not meet to labour any more, for it was nothing but vainly to ſpend
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:17285:144"/> time, ſeeing that to yeeld that which the
<hi>Pope</hi> Propoſed, was indeed to yeeld all the Cauſe, which if they had beene willing to doe, they could haue done it without any mediation of any Perſon. But the <hi>Senate</hi> to ſatisfie the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the
<hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> made him anſwer, that with aſtoniſhment they vnderſtood the change of the Propoſitions, and that thereby it was eaſie to ſee that the intention of the <hi>Pope</hi> was not ſuch as hee would make the world beleeue, ſince the new Propoſitions were full of contrarieties and inſuperable difficulties. Touching the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, that they could render them to ſatisfie the <hi>King,</hi> as a thing already accepted by his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie</hi> and himſelfe, neuertheleſſe with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that it ſhould be without preiudice; but that they could not conſent to any of the other Propoſitions, as being perillous and contrary to their Gouernment; That to ſend before an <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador,</hi> were to publiſh to all the World that they had erred, and that the Excommunication was iuſt, as contrarily to condemne of iniuſtice all that which the
<hi>Republique</hi> had done in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their innocency: that to recall at the ſame time the <hi>Religious,</hi> ſhould be to make them triumph for an action of diſobedience, and for
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:17285:145"/> abandoning their Countrey, it being ſufficient to remit this Matter to be treated by their
<hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador</hi> with his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> on this particular ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great occurrences being to be conſidered; That to demand aſſurance of the <hi>King,</hi> that the Lawes ſhould not be executed, was a thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, and no leſſe preiudiciall to his <hi>Maieſty,</hi> than to the
<hi>Republique,</hi> who were reſolued to execute their Lawes, and further clearely ſaid, that they would not giue care to any Suſpenſion or altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them in any part. For when the World ſhould ſee them executed, after the <hi>King</hi> had contrarily paſſed his word, Men would haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to beleeue, either that the <hi>Republique</hi> had failed in their Promiſe vnto the <hi>King,</hi> or that he had bin moued too lightly, and without ground to oblige his word. The <hi>Senate</hi> ſaid further, that without doubt the <hi>K.</hi> would not take in good part this alteration, which implied little reſpect vnto his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> in whoſe regard the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> had condeſcended as farre as they might: And although this manner of proceeding by the <hi>Pope</hi> might (and happily ought) induce the <hi>Republique</hi> to retract all which hitherto they had accorded, notwithſtanding to make it appeare that on their part they had not failed to doe all
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:17285:145"/> that was poſſible to preuent the trouble and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet of <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> they had a good purpoſe to continue in their good diſpoſition to an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, and conſtantly to ſtand by their word already giuen, notwithſtanding the inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the <hi>Pope,</hi> who if he would not yeeld to reaſon, yet the
<hi>Senate</hi> hoped to haue ſtill good intelligence with his
<hi>Maieſtie;</hi> for as much as they had teſtified the great eſteeme which they made of his Mediation, for that they had in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of him remitted many of their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts. At the ſame time alſo the
<hi>Senate</hi> gaue the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> to vnderſtand, that vpon his requeſt all Preſſes at <hi>Venice</hi> had beene ſtayed, and order giuen that no Bookes vpon this Difference ſhould be imprinted: That neuertheleſſe from <hi>Rome</hi> and elſewhere came forth many Libels in behalfe of the <hi>Pope,</hi> that the Treatiſes written in fauour of the
<hi>Republique</hi> were condemned, the Authours and Printers proceeded againſt by Cenſures, and other vndue courſes: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they ſhould be conſtrained, by way of neceſſary defence, to giue libertie vnto their Printers, as before, to the end that their iuſt Reaſons might bee made knowne to all the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:17285:146"/> The time paſſed in theſe Negotiations vntill the middle of <hi>Nouember,</hi> about which time ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued at
<hi>Venice, Don Francis de Caſtro,</hi> ſent <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador Extraordinary</hi> from the <hi>Catholique K.</hi> for to employ himſelfe in the reconciling of theſe Diſſentions betweene the <hi>Pope</hi> and the
<hi>Republique.</hi> From the beginning they conceiued in <hi>Spaine,</hi> that it would be greatly aduantageous to their affaires, to accommodate theſe Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies: as well to preuent all occaſions of War in <hi>Italie,</hi> as becauſe they ſaw the <hi>French</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe in the buſineſſe. Wherefore after long deliberation to whom this Charge ſhould be committed, the <hi>King</hi> at laſt ſetled vpon <hi>Don Francis de Castro,</hi> a Principall Perſon of great Authority, hauing beene
<hi>Viceroy</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> and highly eſteemed, as Nephew to the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lerma.</hi> Yet he came not by and by, after he had order from <hi>Spaine,</hi> but ſtaied at <hi>Gaëta</hi> ſome daies, becauſe <hi>D.

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:17285:146"/> 
               <hi>Dukes</hi> word, that as well the Souldiers already prepared, as they that ſhould be leuied hereafter, were not to offend the <hi>Pope</hi> in any faſhion, but onely in defence of their
<hi>Eſtate</hi> in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie. But the principall cauſe of his ſtay was to expect the Arriuall of <hi>Aiton</hi> the new
<hi>Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador</hi> of the <hi>Catholique King</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> a Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage who had great knowledge of this Affaire, and who had charge to keepe good correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in his Treating with the <hi>Pope,</hi> to the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation of <hi>Don Francis de Caſtro</hi> at <hi>Venice;</hi> which they could not hope from the <hi>Marquis de Villena</hi> then
<hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> for that he had too openly declared himſelfe inclined to the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Pope,</hi> ſo far that he had diſguſted them in <hi>Spaine.</hi> The <hi>Marquis</hi> had order from the

            <p>
               <hi>Don Francis</hi> being arriued at <hi>Venice,</hi> was extraordinarily honoured by the <hi>Republique,</hi> and defrayed at the coſt of 100. Crownes by the day. This <hi>Lord</hi> had no ſpeciall Commiſſion from the <hi>King</hi> touching the particulars of this Affaire, becauſe he knew not in what caſe it was, and how to manage it effectually as yet; but onely he had Order to ſpeake at firſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, to the end that conſidering from day to day what was needfull to be done, he might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter accordingly deſcend to particulars. Vpon this Reaſon, in the publique Audience, where hee was receiued with all demonſtrations of Honour, he did not paſſe the termes of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements: and in the firſt which he had in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, he preſented the Letter of the <hi>King</hi> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the
5. of <hi>Auguſt;</hi> wherein, after he had teſtified his good Will towards the <hi>Republique,</hi> he added, That hee had reſolued to ſend
<hi>Don Francis de Caſtro</hi> to compoſe the Controuerſies which they had with his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> vnto the contentment of the
<hi>Republique.</hi> And <hi>Caſtro</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing preſented the Letter, ſaid, That he was ſent by the <hi>King</hi> for the deſire which hee had of Peace, and for the good of the <hi>Republique,</hi> and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:17285:148"/> of all <hi>Italie,</hi> in fauour of which hee deſired to doe more if he could: That for himſelfe he had willingly vndertaken this Charge, both in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> and for the affection which he carried to the <hi>Repub.</hi> hoping eaſily to conclude a good Peace with his <hi>Serenity,</hi> ſeeing he ſhould meet with none of thoſe three Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, which vſually render all Treaties diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; which are, Firſt, the Paſſion or extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie Affection of him in whoſe name men Treat, or of him who Treateth: Secondly, the Inconuenience of the matter Treated: and Thirdly, the incapacitie or want of good will in the Perſon with whom the Treatie is. For, touching the firſt, it was certaine that the <hi>King</hi> his Maſter was well affected, and had no other aimes but the common good: That the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the
<hi>Republique</hi> was aduantageous to Him, as being the Bulwarke of
<hi>Chriſtendome</hi> againſt the power of the <hi>Turkes.</hi> And for his owne Perſon, hee proteſted that he was not come to vſe Deceit, being noble by Birth, and therefore obliged to ſpeake Truth aboue all things. Touching the ſecond, the point of Treaty was for Peace, a thing excellent, and for an Vnion with the <hi>See Apoſtolique,</hi> a thing very
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:17285:148"/> profitable to the <hi>Republique,</hi> all Hiſtories being full of the mutuall good offices which they haue euer rendered the one to the other; as on the contrary, their Diſunion muſt needs be very pernicious to the <hi>Repub.</hi> for if their cauſe were vniuſt, it would incenſe all <hi>Princes</hi> againſt them, and though it were reaſonable, yet was it not fit therefore to forget what Reuerence men owe to the Soueraigne <hi>Biſhop.</hi> Touching the third, that the Treaty here was with a <hi>Senate</hi> of great Prudence, Louers of Peace, enemies of Nouelty, who had beene alwaies Authors of Tranquillitie in <hi>Italie,</hi> not of any Troubles. He diſcourſed further of the damages of War, and the miſchiefes of Hereſies, ſaying, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Republique</hi> by their owne ſtrength and greatneſſe could ſuſtaine all ſorts of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and were able to withſtand ſufficiently all that ſhould aſſault them, neuertheleſſe other ſuccours (although not expected or deſired) would vncalled offer themſelues, and ſuch, as might be ſuſpected, hand to diſmiſſe, and ſo much more hurtfull as
<hi>Italy</hi> was in good eſtate, whence might ariſe many corruptions which might put their Gouernment in great danger. As theſe things were conſiderable, ſo the <hi>King</hi>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:17285:149"/> his Maſter accordingly had beene willing to aduertiſe them thereof, for the affection which He and his Aunceſtors euer haue had to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique,</hi> and for that all are commonly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed in the Peace of <hi>Italie:</hi> and he praied them to referre all matters to ſome Arbiters, Himſelfe and others: That the <hi>King</hi> did thinke himſelfe obliged by way of gratitude to interpoſe in this affaire, as remembring that ſometime the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi> had interpoſed to accommodate ſome Differences betweene the <hi>Emperour</hi> his Grand Father and the <hi>King</hi> his Father, and the <hi>Pope.</hi> That it was very neceſſarie for <hi>Princes</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their reputation, but yet they ought not to deale too rigorouſly with the <hi>Pope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </gap> no other way to this end, but that the <hi>Repub</hi> ſhould in ſome ſort ſatisfie the
<hi>Pope;</hi> and that if he could coniecture what would be acceptable
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:17285:149"/> to the <hi>Senate,</hi> he would willingly propoſe it, but being not able to doe it, that he would expect from his
<hi>Serenitie</hi> ſome temperament which he might carry vnto the
<hi>Pope,</hi> and he would la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with all his power that it might be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; his purpoſe being not thereby to hinder any Treaties already in hand, but rather to coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſo far as hee could, inaſmuch as it was not the intention of his <hi>King</hi> to take the Treaty out of the hands of the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> as deſiring nought elſe but that an Accord might follow, which would be as pleaſing to him if Others could performe it, as if he Himſelfe. To this the <hi>Senate</hi> anſwered, praiſing firſt the great piety of the <hi>Catholique</hi> K. and his good will to Peace, and thanking his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> for his good Offices to pacific theſe contentions; adioyning; that they ſaw willingly and with much content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> principally for the Perſon of the

Then they paſſed to particulars, ſaying, That they had vſed all kindes of humilitie and of reſpect towards

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:17285:150"/> the <hi>Pope,</hi> and alſo done all good offices which might be deſired, to the end that he ſhould no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:17285:150"/> and to repulſe iniuries; by conſequent, that it was needleſſe to perſwade them to the Peace ſo much required, but it was meet to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe themſelues to Him from whom the euill proceeded, &amp; who ſtill was the cauſe that it was not remedied.

<hi>Maſter;</hi> from whom though he had order to procure with all his power an Agreement, yet had he not Commiſſion to deſcend to particulars. And if he ſhould reſolue to write that he might receiue order to this effect; it would be a thing too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and no way proportionable to the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire which required ſpeedy reſolution, &amp; which with Time would grow worſe and worſe. That he was a Stranger in the Buſineſſe, and therefore
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:17285:151"/> not to be remembred of what was paſt, but when the <hi>Senate</hi> would declare their wil to him with confidence, he would effectually propoſe it, and cauſe it to be accepted.</p>
            <p>To this the <hi>Duke</hi> immediatly anſwered, that when the
<hi>Senate</hi> ſhould vnderſtand what the <hi>Pope</hi> deſired, they could Treat and make decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their will; but the way being ſhut vp by reaſon of the <hi>Interdict,</hi> if that were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, no good Treaty could poſſibly be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered. Therefore ſince he deſired to know the intention of the <hi>Republique,</hi> that this it was, to wit, that all things might be reeſtabliſhed in that eſtate wherein they were before the
<hi>Monitorie</hi> publiſhed, and that the <hi>Pope</hi> would Treat with them, as a Father with his Children, ſo as he was obliged, which if he had done, all men had been freed from all theſe Troubles. Here <hi>D. Francis</hi> ſaid, that this Propoſition to reſtore all things to their firſt eſtate, would be diuerſly interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe the
<hi>Republique</hi> vnderſtood it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Cenſures,</hi> and the
<hi>Pope</hi> without doubt would take it, for the Time going before the Lawes. Whereunto the <hi>Duke</hi> replied, ſaying, That it ſufficed to bring matters into ſuch caſe, that the Treaty might be as betweene the Father and

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:17285:151"/> the Sons, and that then by means of the Treatie other things might eaſily be accommodated, as they had beene ere then, if the <hi>Pope</hi> had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoiled himſelfe of the quality of a Father, and taken that of an Enemy. And though all were brought backe to that eſtate wherein they were before the Promulgation of the Laws, yet things had beene then more eaſie to accord, becauſe they ſhould haue had to doe with a <hi>Clement</hi> 8. or a <hi>Leo</hi> 11 who had not occaſioned theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, as they did not any, although the Lawes in their time for the greater part were publiſhed: thoſe <hi>Popes</hi> knowing right well what was the Authority of a <hi>Prince,</hi> free and independant, and not mingling themſelues in any faſhion in the Gouernment of another. The
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> then concluded, that hee would make the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and to that effect employ himſelfe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Senate</hi> conſidered that it was not meet to giue an abſolute repulſe to an <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> ſent expreſly from ſo great a <hi>King,</hi> and for this particular Affaire; alſo that it ſhould be inciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, if they did not communicate with him that which they had yeelded in Fauour of the <hi>Moſt Chriſtian King,</hi> and which might giue him occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:17285:152"/> to retire himſelfe with diſcontent, ſeeing the ſmall care they had to correſpond vnto the good Offices by him done, a thing which might be of ill conſequence. Wherefore they determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to communicate all vnto him, firſt aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Freſne</hi> hereof, and giuing him to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that this ſhould not hinder the progreſſe of the Treaty begun by the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Maſter,</hi> for as much as
<hi>Don Francis de Caſtro</hi> had clearely ſaid, that he would not plucke the Treaty out of his hands; and although he had the ſame Deſigne, yet the Accord would be acknowledged en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely from his <hi>King.</hi> But
<hi>Freſne</hi> vnderſtanding the intention of the <hi>Senate,</hi> was not only well pleaſed with this communication, but further ſaid, That he eſteemed it neceſſary, it being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that the <hi>Pope</hi> would communicate all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and therefore if they ſhould conceale what had paſſed, it might giue occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of diffidence; That for this reaſon they might aſſure themſelues, the <hi>King</hi> would reſt content. To which he added, that the <hi>Pope</hi> had intreated him by
<hi>Alincourt,</hi> to be willing to ioyne his Offices with thoſe of <hi>Don Francis de Caſtro;</hi> wherein he knew not what the <hi>Pope</hi> intended, or whereat he aimed, and therefore had written
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:17285:152"/> that his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> would further declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; becauſe if his meaning were, that what his
<hi>Holineſſe</hi> and the <hi>Republique</hi> had yeelded in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Maſter,</hi> ſhould be thought to be done in like manner in Fauour of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> this was to alter all the Affaire, to which he could not agree without expreſſe Order from the
<hi>King.</hi> Wherefore he approued their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>cation with <hi>Don Francis,</hi> ſo as they did not paſſe to any further Treaty, and that they did not at his inſtance what had beene already done for his <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Francis de Caſtro</hi> being then called into the
<hi>Senate</hi> before the <hi>Duke,</hi> they read vnto him all that had paſſed vntill that day, together with that which the <hi>Pope</hi> had required of the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> and what they had yeelded in Fauour of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> Which when he had heard, he thanked the
<hi>Senate</hi> for this Communication, and for the confidence they had in him, adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, That for further correſpondence and to breake the ice, which already began to melt, he would propoſe a meane which to him ſeemed very proper ſpeedily to end theſe Controuerſies, which ſhould not be any of thoſe things which the <hi>Senate</hi> had iuſtly rejected, whereof it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:17285:153"/> to ſpeake. And therefore ommitting the reuocation or Suſpenſion of their Lawes indeed preiudiciall to their Liberty, he would Propoſe a Suſpenſion only for a time, of fiue, foure, or three moneths, with Conditions very cleare; That what the
<hi>Republique</hi> did herein, was only to open a way vnto a Treaty, and out of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding deſire to the Publique quiet, &amp; by way of Gratification to the Two <hi>Kings;</hi> That by ſo doing, the <hi>Republique</hi> ſhould be ſo farre from receiuing any loſſe or preiudice, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary they ſhould gaine a great aduantage, for that their hands ſhould not be tyed to enter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into their former eſtate, and becauſe a <hi>State</hi> ſo well founded, and of ſuch Antiquitie, could not hereby receiue alteration: That the <hi>Repub.</hi> had condeſcended ſo far, as that no more could be deſired. For, touching the Priſoners, it was very reaſonable that they ſhould not be rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but with a reſeruation of their Reaſons; That, being content the <hi>Pope</hi> might be prayed, the
<hi>Republique</hi> therein had teſtified their Deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: as alſo, to ſend an <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> when the <hi>Cenſures</hi> were remoued, was a notable teſtimony of the good will of the
<hi>Republique</hi> towards the <hi>Pope,</hi> wherewith He ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:17285:153"/> himſelfe, and hee beleeued that at laſt hee would be therewith ſatisfied. But ſince all this did not bring matters to a concluſion, (as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared that till then they had concluded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) he therefore propoſed this Suſpenſion for a time, which (as it ſeemed to him) could bring no preiudice. And he adioyned, that he would doe his vtmoſt endeuour, that an accord might follow; and although the
<hi>Marqueſſe d'Aiton</hi> was very ſufficient to treat this affaire with the <hi>Pope,</hi> notwithſtanding, if it did ſeeme good to them, that he ſhould ſend a Gentleman expreſly to this end, or that himſelfe ſhould goe in Perſon, hee was readie to doe all that they ſhould deſire of him, ſo vehemently did he long to ſee this Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference accommodate.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> anſwered him, that he was very ioyfull to ſee his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> reſt ſatisfied, and that he acknowledged the ſinceritie of the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> together with the Reuerence they had to the <hi>See Apoſtolique</hi> in the forme of their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; as alſo how falſe it was which their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had divulged, that the <hi>Repub.</hi> purpoſed to ſeparate themſelues from the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Holy See.</hi> That notwithſtanding they were ſtill min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to preſerue their Liberty, with all that which
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:17285:154"/> was neceſſary for the Tranquillitie of the
<hi>State.</hi> And ſeeing himſelfe confeſſed that they ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> yeelded very much, they did not thinke fit to admit of any new Propoſitions, ſince they had done more than at the beginning they purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſo much that he had an eaſie way ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to come to a Concluſion, if he did not do murre vpon what the
<hi>Pope</hi> was euery day pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, his thoughts hauing no bound or limit. For if to day he obtaine one thing, to morrow he demands another, ſaying, he craues but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little for his reputation, and then makes it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that much contents him not. Vpon this Reaſon, that the
<hi>Republique</hi> was reſolued not to paſſe further, and rather to runne a hazard of any euill fortune, than ſubmit their neckes vnder the yoake, ſince they could not be in worſe caſe than ſo. That
<hi>Princes</hi> their Friends ought no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to deſire of the <hi>Republique</hi> what was not conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, but only, according to the Prouerb, things honeſt: nor ought the hopes of the
<hi>Pope</hi> to be fomented, by endeuouring that he might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that which was not reaſonable; conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that it was not onely the caſe of the
<hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> but alſo of all other <hi>Princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Senate</hi> hauing alſo heard the Propoſition
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:17285:154"/> of <hi>Don Francis de Caſtro</hi> read, made this anſwer; That the Suſpenſion, as it was propoſed, did ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely weaken the Power of Gouernment, and therefore they could not poſſibly condeſcend vnto it: wherefore they were reſolued not to giue eare to ſuch a Propoſition. But ſince that which was already yeelded, afforded ample matter for a Treaty, <hi>Don Francis</hi> might ioyne himſelfe with the
<hi>French,</hi> and turne himſelfe to the <hi>Pope,</hi> who ought to be fully ſatisfied with the Conditions by them granted. To which <hi>Don Francis</hi> replied, that his <hi>Maſter</hi> had not ſent him to the
<hi>Pope,</hi> but to the <hi>Republique,</hi> and that his iourney ſhould be without fruit, becauſe the <hi>Pope</hi> would tell him that he brought no newes, and that others had made vnto him the ſame Propoſition: and that he came to no other end than to perſwade him to doe that which he had refuſed at the inſtance of another; That he could not make this iourney but as from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſince he had no charge from the <hi>King</hi> to vſe therein his Name, but onely in that which ſhould be granted vpon his demand. And here he endeuoured with great efficacie to perſwade the Suſpenſion for a certaine time, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly he propoſed, ſhewing in the firſt place
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:17285:155"/> that it was a thing which could not bring them any preiudice, for as much as they were not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by any violence vnto it, in which caſe only their Liberty ſhould be wronged, but it ſhould be a pure Gratification yeelded by good will and that to ſuſpend for a time, was not to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend abſolutely, but was a petty thing, and of no conſideration. Then arguing from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of him from whom it was propoſed, he ſaid, the Reputation of that great <hi>King</hi> ſhould be much diminiſhed, if he could nothing preuaile that he could not demand the Priſoners, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that they were already yeelded to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> in whoſe Fauour hauing done this, it was meet to doe as much for his
<hi>King,</hi> and the kindneſſe would be equall, if they granted vnto him this Suſpenſion. Withall <hi>Don Francis</hi> adioyned his owne particular Intereſts, ſaying That indeed he ſaw himſelfe welcomed, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with many magnifice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrations of Honour, but all this he did not eſteeme in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of that Honour which he might haue by according the Diſſentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. For if he obtained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, Men would beleeue that he was ignorant how to Treat, or that he had beene circumuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and ſo much more neceſſary was it for him
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:17285:155"/> to ſpeed in this, being the firſt Negotiation by him made, wherein if he did nothing, nor could preuaile, his reputation, and that of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lerma</hi> his Vncle, would be much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired. The <hi>Senate</hi> thought it expedient to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer amply to this inſtance made with ſo much heat and affection, and therefore clearely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; That hauing already ſpoken at large touching the preiudices which they foreſaw vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Suſpenſion, the <hi>Senate</hi> beleeued that he would haue beene therewith fully ſatisfied: but becauſe he had taken the paines to reply, and therein to ſhew that he was not contented, for two Reaſons, They told him, for the firſt, that ſuch a Suſpenſion would not indeed be conceiued as forced from them, if there had not beene an Excommunication preceding: but ſo long as the <hi>Pope</hi> held the Scourge in his hand, and the <hi>Republique</hi> was offended by the
<hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> the offence being ſtill without remedy, it could not be ſaid that they had freely conſented to what was demanded: and that ſo much the leſſe, for that the <hi>Pope</hi> continued to refreſh the wound by ſuggeſting vnto the <hi>Eccleſiaſtiques,</hi> that they ſhould endeuour to corrupt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to ſcatter his tares, to multiply Writings
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:17285:156"/> and defamatorie Libels, willing by theſe cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to conſtraine them to render themſelues whence men might collect that whatſoeuer paſſed on this faſhion was not voluntary, or done out of pleaſure, but on the contrary that the <hi>Republique</hi> being not able to ſubſiſt any longer had yeelded, ſhewing in effect by this Suſpenſion that the Lawes were worthy of <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;</hi> &amp; ſo the Exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication ſhould take force &amp; authority &amp; would appeare lawfull, which is not true; as alſo the world might beleeue, that to auoid a plaine and direct confeſſion of their error, they had confeſſed it indirectly by way of gratifying another: that vpon iuſt reaſon they had alwaies ſaid, and did againe repeat it, that when the <hi>Cenſures</hi> ſhould bee remoued, and a friendly Treaty proſecuted, then it was fit to ſpeake of gratifications, and the time would be proper to conclude. That the ſecond Reaſon was not of any conſideration, to ſay that the Suſpenſion for a time was not any way preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall; it being no good conſequence, that it brings no preiudice at all, becauſe not ſo much as a perpetuall Suſpenſion: as it followes not that a man is no whit offended becauſe hee might be more: alſo that the compariſon was
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:17285:156"/> no better of the yeelding of the Priſoners with the Suſpenſion of the Lawes, ſince the one was but a Conceſſion in a particular caſe, but the Lawes were generall which comprehend infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite caſes, and for this reaſon they could not yeeld this to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> howſoeuer he demanded it very inſtantly, as they had yeelded the Priſoners. Beſides that the Suſpenſion would giue men occaſion to diſpute of the thing ſuſpended, and to queſtion their Liberty and Authoritie, and it was no ſmall curteſie that the
<hi>Republique</hi> had promiſed to come to an amiable Treaty after the reuocation of the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</hi> Wherefore the <hi>Senate</hi> aſſured themſelues that the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> would for theſe reaſons reſt ſatisfied, holding for certaine that neither the
<hi>Catholique King</hi> nor himſelfe had any purpoſe to doe them preiudice, according as they had many times proteſted; eſpecially hauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his hands which the <hi>Pope</hi> had yeelded, nor any particular of the intentions of his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> neither ſpeciall Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion from the <hi>King</hi> his Maſter. But that by the communication made vnto him, he had a ſpacious field to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe himſelfe with the <hi>Pope,</hi> to the end that hee might content himſelfe with that which the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:17285:157"/> 
               <hi>Republique</hi> had yeelded, firſt for to gratifie the <hi>King</hi> his Maſter, and then in conſideration of the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>France:</hi> who hauing alwaies pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued the Treaty, had obtained that at his requeſt the <hi>Republique</hi> had granted all that might be, to teſtifie their good inclination to Peace, and their reuerence towards the <hi>Holy See,</hi> as they had done the like for the <hi>King Catholique,</hi> if he had intreated them: and that they were induced to yeeld ſo far vpon the aſſurance which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them, that by ſuch meanes the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe would be ended. That they were willing to performe what had beene yeelded, vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that the <hi>Cenſures</hi> ſhould bee reuoked, which the <hi>Pope</hi> not being willing to do, the act of the
<hi>Senate</hi> was not irreuocable, but on the contrary both parties remained in their firſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. Yet notwithſtanding the mutabilitie of the
<hi>Pope</hi> and his incertitude, the <hi>Senate</hi> deſirous to manifeſt their ſinceritie, would firmely keepe their word. Wherefore if <hi>Don Francis</hi> would make vſe of theſe conceſſions, and ioyne his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices with the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> haply hee might obtaine what others could not, and ſo he ſhould not returne without ſucceſſe; on the contrary, he ſhould haue a great part in the Accord, with
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:17285:157"/> the praiſe to haue accompliſhed by his firſt Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation ſo high an enterpriſe. That if the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> had beene willing to yeeld a Suſpenſion, all had beene finiſhed without the interpoſing of any Perſon, and without his comming, ſince there remained nothing for the <hi>Pope</hi> but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: which could not be called an Accord, the aduantage being all of one ſide, and on the ſide of him who had offended, which ought to be quite contrary. That if he would turne to the <hi>Pope,</hi> he might at leaſt ſay ſomething vpon good ground of the Intention of the <hi>Pope;</hi> and employing the authority of the
<hi>King</hi> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, might haply obtaine of his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> to be contented with this ouerture, which of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie muſt content him, ſeeing that if the <hi>Senate</hi> could yeeld any farther, they would deale plainely with him and acquaint him, although he had not any thing in hand from the <hi>Pope,</hi> as is the cuſtome of Miniſters which interpoſe themſelues, to take the word of either Partie, the better to conclude an Accord. <hi>Don Francis</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated what hee had already ſaid, that hee was not content with their anſwer, to which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that he did not Treat as an Ordinary <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador,</hi> who when hee hath propounded and

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:17285:158"/> receiued anſwer, proceeds no further, and alſo that the Affaire it ſelfe was not ordinarie: That he could not ſee by theſe diſcourſes what glory he could haue by his Negotiation: That he was well entertained, much viſited and honoured, but in the eſſentiall point he receiued no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment: That if he would goe to <hi>Rome</hi> the
<hi>Pope</hi> would ſay vnto him, You doe not bring any new thing, for that which you offer was giuen by another: That it was meet to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh his
<hi>King</hi> from others, and to doe in his conſideration ſomething more, ſeeing he had ſent him expreſly, that which others had not done: That if he had not any thing from the <hi>Pope,</hi> the reaſon was becauſe he came from the <hi>King</hi> his Maſter to the <hi>Republique</hi> to receiue from them and to carry vnto the <hi>Pope</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which might conſerue both the Dignitie of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the Liberty of the
<hi>Republique:</hi> That he did not know what the <hi>Pope</hi> deſired, and if he ſaid he knew he ſhould not ſay truth: That if the <hi>Pope</hi> had ſignified to others his minde to agree vpon the Conditions imparted to him, and after had recalled his word, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertained to him to defend himſelfe; he deſired to know who were herein the Mediators, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:17285:158"/> in might bee they had ſaid ſomething which the <hi>Pope</hi> would deny that he ſpake vnto them. In the end, he prayed them affectionately, to thinke anow vpon that which he had ſaid, and to make him anſwer. But ſeeing they did not anſwer him at the preſent, he demanded to haue Audience in the <hi>Dukes</hi> chamber, becauſe he hoped to find the <hi>Prince</hi> with leſſe aſſiſtance of <hi>Senators,</hi> and ſo to diſcourſe more familiarly with him, or becauſe he beleeued he might ſay ſome what more proper for the Affaire in the abſence of <hi>Don Innigo de Cardenas</hi> the Ordinary <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> who greatly obſerued to Treat with reputation conuenient to the dignitie of his <hi>King, Don Francis</hi> therefore being come into the chamber of the <hi>Duke</hi> where the <hi>Senate</hi> were aſſembled, accompanied onely by the <hi>Duke de Vietri,</hi> he made in the firſt place a long diſcourſe of the fauours and honours which he receiued daily from the <hi>Republique,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Duke de Vietri</hi> ſaid to be extraordinarie. Then he ſaid, that he came into that priuate place to ſpeake more freely and without ſo many witneſſes; and the ſubſtance of his Diſcourſe was, That he had now beene three and forty daies in <hi>Venice;</hi> where the people ſaid, that he did nothing but
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:17285:159"/> play the ſmell-feaſt: That he was young, and that the old ones would diſpatch him with good words without effects: That as he had a good affection for the ſeruice of his <hi>Serenitie,</hi> ſo he deſired to ſee the like on his part recipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally; but the
<hi>Republique</hi> would propoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor accept that which he had propoſed, although the Reaſons which he vrged were ſo ſtrong that they were vnanſwerable; as well in concluding, that the Suſpenſion required was a ſmall thing and eaſie to be granted, as in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating that ſo much being done at the Petition of the <hi>French,</hi> it was fit at leaſt to doe a little in gratification of the <hi>Catholique King,</hi> which was no leſſe worthy, no leſſe friendly; nor leſſe officious towards the
<hi>Republique.</hi> And here with much eloquence (wherein verily he excelled) he propoſed, repeated, and amplified the ſame things, with the ſame reaſons, making a formall Oration full of ſentences &amp; conceits, inlarging principally the argument drawne from the reputation of the
<hi>King</hi> his <hi>Maſter,</hi> of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lerma,</hi> and of Himſelfe. To which the <hi>Duke</hi> anſwered, and let him ſee that he had ample occaſion to employ himſelfe, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe reputation by meanes of that which had
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:17285:159"/> beene communicated to him, and expounded more ſuccinctly what the <hi>Senate</hi> had ſaid, to wit, that <hi>Don Innigo</hi> had beene the firſt who had put the Difference in Treaty, and had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to make the two firſt paces. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it could not be ſaid that nothing had been done in fauour of <hi>Spaine:</hi> but after <hi>Don Innigo</hi> paſſing no farther, and the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing himſelfe, this gaue occaſion to the <hi>Republique</hi> to goe on ſo far, to ſhew themſelues deſirous of, Peace and full of reſpect to the <hi>Church</hi> which thing they had alſo done at the inſtance of the <hi>Catholique King,</hi> if he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his Offices. But although there paſſed many anſwers and replies of <hi>Don Francis</hi> and the <hi>Duke de Vietri,</hi> yet in concluſion nothing was determined.</p>
            <p>In the meane while at <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> vpon all occaſions continued to make inſtance with <hi>Alincourt,</hi> that the
<hi>French</hi> Miniſters would vnite their Offices with the
<hi>Spaniards;</hi> which was diuerſly interpreted. Some ſaid it was out of his deſire that the Accord might be effected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he feared left, if they proceeded ſeuerally, they might hinder one the other through rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſie, or other reſpects, which ordinarily doe
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:17285:160"/> not permit that any Affaire come to good end, which is handled by two Mediators, who doe not communicate together. Others ſaid on the contrary, that to hinder all good ſucceſſe in the buſineſſe, he deſired that it might be managed by the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> to the end that one ſhould vndoe what the other had done, which vſually comes to paſſe, when an Affaire is vndertaken ioyntly by thoſe who haue diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ends and intereſts, and when there is no likelyhood that the one will yeeld to the other. At <hi>Rome, Alincourt</hi> anſwered, that it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to haue firſt ſome order and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the <hi>King.</hi> And at <hi>Venice, Freſne</hi> was diſpleaſed, that ſuch a thought ſhould come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the
<hi>Popes</hi> head, ſaying openly, that he knew not what end he had, vnleſſe it were his owne aduantage: but that he ſaw well, this was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but to croſſe the Treaty of the <hi>King</hi> his Maſter; ſince hauing often propoſed the Suſpenſion, which the <hi>Pope</hi> ſaid he demanded onely in apparence, and to haue ſome colour to preſerue his Dignity and Authoritie, the <hi>Senate</hi> had ſtill denied it as a thing moſt preiudicall, and therefore he ſaw not how they could now yeeld it: On the contrary, he requeſted the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:17285:160"/> when they had a purpoſe to grant more then they had done at the inſtance of the <hi>King</hi> his Maſter, that it would pleaſe them to let him know it, to the end that he might accordingly gouerne himſelfe. Alſo when the reſolution gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to <hi>Don Francis de Caſtro,</hi> that they would not in any ſort condeſcend to the Suſpenſion, was communicated to him, he aſſured them his <hi>King</hi> in that Matter would ſollicite them to farther.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe things were treated at <hi>Rome</hi> and a
<hi>Venice,</hi> the <hi>Emperour</hi> continuing in his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to interpoſe himſelfe for the accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this diſſention, reſolued to giue the charge hereof to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> and to the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Caſtillon,</hi> with ſome prerogatiue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Duke;</hi> but without touching any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in their Commiſſion, only in generall giuing them order to Treat the Manner in what manner they ſhould ſee fit; yet ſo ſame reſeruing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that when there ſhould happen any point of moment, they ſhould giue him aduice, and wait his anſwer. This his reſolution being ſent to the

               <hi>Spaine.</hi> But in thoſe two <hi>Kingdoms</hi> he found many oppoſitions. The

And when they could not be heard neither of the
<hi>Senate,</hi> nor of the <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> nor of the <hi>Count,</hi> they appealed into <hi>Spaine:</hi> Wherefore the <hi>Count</hi> gaue order to remit the Oxen of the <hi>State,</hi> and he procured 400 horſes out of

He made alſo a view of Armes which were within the Magazins, where he found 1500. Harneſſe for the body, 2000. Harquebuzes, and 500. Muskets. He prohibited the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> to carry any Armes out of the

Muskets, which were ſpeedily granted He diſpatched alſo
<hi>Nicholas Doria</hi> Maſter of the Campe, with 20000. Crownes, to aſſure him 3000. <hi>Wallons,</hi> who quickly returned without doing any thing; becauſe the <hi>Archduke</hi> hauing vſe of men for his owne occaſions would not permit the Leuie. He treated likewiſe with the
<hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Emps</hi> to leuie 4000. Lance-knights, to put them in Armes beyond the Mountaines, and to oppoſe the <hi>Lorraines,</hi> but nothing was executed. He cauſed a muſter of <hi>Horſemen</hi> to be made at <hi>Lodi</hi> and at <hi>Pauia,</hi> but they appeared all on borrowed horſes; and to prouide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of ſome good horſe, beſides the 250. light horſe of the Guard, and the ordinarie Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of ſouldiers (the number whereof excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not 200.) he adioyned 600. Cuiraſles well arm'd and mounted, although the bruit ran that they were 800. Whereupon he had in foot
14000. men, and 650. horſe. He made account to lodge the <hi>Albanes,</hi> gathered out of the Realme of <hi>Naples,</hi> within the <hi>State</hi> of
<hi>Parma,</hi> and the

            </p>
            <p>All theſe Prouiſions could not be preſently in readineſſe, but onely in the end of <hi>March</hi> arriued at <hi>Vareſe</hi> almoſt all the <hi>Germans,</hi> ſtout men and old Souldiers, who had beene in the Warres of <hi>Hungary,</hi> but were without Armes, bare foot and naked, many being ſicke for want of neceſſaries, and it was thought they had the Plague amongſt them. After the Moneth of <hi>Aprill,</hi> the
<hi>Suiſſes</hi> began to arriue at <hi>Lomellina,</hi> and being about the number of 3000. were ſent to lodge in the Territory of <hi>Lodi:</hi> and hauing no other meanes to lodge the 3000 <hi>Neapolitans,</hi> he thought to giue them lodging in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs of <hi>Milan,</hi> which highly offended the
<hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> complaining that their Priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges were violated, and the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of the Prouiſions gaue him to vnderſtand that hee would not conſent to this, making thereupon many Proteſtations. And certes in all that ſpace of time the <hi>Count</hi> found many obſtacles. The other Miniſters of the <hi>Catholique King</hi> had little correſpondence with him, ſo as <hi>Don Francis de Caſtro</hi> did not communicate vnto him any thing of that which hee treated at
<hi>Venice.</hi> He
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:17285:166"/> had need of money, and the Commons of the State of <hi>Milan</hi> not onely did not obey him cheerefully, but euen made reſiſtance; ſo that the pleaſure which he tooke in Arming, was very much counterpoyſed with many vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Accidents which fell out.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> ſeeing the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> to Arme themſelues, could not in reaſon of
<hi>State</hi> remaine without Forces which might be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to thoſe of their Enemies, Wherefore to meet with all occaſions which might occurre, they ſent to <hi>Padua, Verona, Breſcia, Crema</hi> and <hi>Bergamo,</hi>
500000. Crownes, 100000. for each Citie to prepare themſelues for all Exigents. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the 9600. footmen, and 600. horſe, and 150. horſe of

<hi>Albanes</hi> vnder <hi>Paul Ghini,</hi> and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Alban</hi> horſe to the number of 1000. men. Alſo order was giuen to <hi>Count Francis Martinengo</hi> to leuie in the Confines 4000. <hi>French</hi> ſouldiers, and

<pb n="305" facs="tcp:17285:166"/> 20 Gallies; and <hi>Nicholas Sagredo Prouiſor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall</hi> by his prudence and dexteritie, which was ſingular in the managing of great Affaires, wrought in ſuch ſort that all was done at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of priuate Gentlemen, which they exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted with ſuch facilitie, that they were firſt of all ready. So that the <hi>Republique</hi> brought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in all 75. light Gallies, and 4. great ones: and in this buſineſſe they did not finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in like caſe with the
<hi>Pope,</hi> who was faine to vſe praiers to many <hi>Princes</hi> for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his reputation; becauſe beſides the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary offers made to the <hi>Republique</hi> by a great number of the <hi>French</hi> Nobilitie, the <hi>Turkes</hi> themſelues did all they could that their ſuccours might be accepted. For beſides that which hath beene ſaid by occaſion of the ſacking of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razzo</hi> in the beginning of the yeere, the ſecond
<hi>Viſier</hi> (the firſt being then at the Warre of <hi>Soria,)</hi> ſent for the <hi>Baylife,</hi> and gaue him notice that the <hi>Grand Seignor</hi> would ſend an Armie to Sea in fauour of the Affaires of the
<hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> and that already they had giuen order to all the
<hi>Sangiacs</hi> of the Confines to giue them leaue to draw out men of War and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition: but that this was nothing, that it was
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:17285:167"/> meet to come to effects &amp; not only to ſtay vpon words. That to free themſelues at once from all ſtratagems and dangers, the <hi>Repub.</hi> ought to vnite with them, to admit their powerfull ſuccour, and come to a ſpeedy execution. The <hi>Baylife</hi> thanked him and ſaid, that as yet the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> had no purpoſe but to defend themſelues, which they hoped to doe by their owne Forces, and the aid of other <hi>Chriſtians</hi> their Friends yet that he receiued willingly their offer to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a leuie of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> their Subiects, with vicutals.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the <hi>Popes</hi> when they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite all the world vnto their ſuccour, were wont to take the pretext of <hi>Religion:</hi> but this Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence hath now ſhewed, that if euer the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould be willing to moue Warre vnder this colour, he would prouoke more men againſt him then on his ſide. The <hi>Turkes</hi> built great Deſignes vpon theſe Controuerſies, in ſo much that they ordained publique faſts and praiers for the continuance of Diſcord among <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and to thanke
<hi>God</hi> for that he had giuen a <hi>Pope</hi> more fauourable to them then any <hi>Mufti</hi> which they could deſire. The <hi>Republique</hi> well vnderſtood that it is not profitable to any
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:17285:167"/> 
               <hi>Prince</hi> to receiue a great ſuccour of a more pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſant <hi>Empire,</hi> and therefore tooke order to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh themſelues with <hi>Italians</hi> ſo many as were poſſible. Alſo the <hi>Senate</hi> ſollicited a leuie of 1800. <hi>Griſons,</hi> for which they had giuen order many months before to their <hi>Reſident</hi> with the <hi>Lords</hi> of the three <hi>Leagues;</hi> commanding him to procure 6. <hi>Captaines</hi> of that <hi>Nation,</hi> with 300. footmen for euery one, and to the ſame effect was ſent a rich donatiue to each
<hi>Captaine.</hi> This Leuie was a little interrupted by the ſecret Counſell of thoſe <hi>Lords,</hi> ſaying, that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to giue aduice here of vnto the <hi>Commons,</hi> although the <hi>Reſident</hi> ſhewed that by the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation of the League betweene the
<hi>Republique</hi> and them, the Leuie might be made without further deliberation with the <hi>Commons.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Affaire being not able to be concealed, but on the contrary being obſerued by the ill affected, they eſſayed to hinder the execution of it, ſcattering a rumor among the people, that ſo long as they ſtood in difference with the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> touching the Fort of <hi>Fuentes,</hi> it was not expedient to exhauſt the Countrey of men or good ſouldiers; and further they frighted the more feeble, telling them, that this was to
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:17285:168"/> prouoke the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> againſt their Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; alſo they added to theſe bad offices, that the Leuie would not pleaſe the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the
<hi>Captaines</hi> were all of the <hi>Priuy Councell,</hi> and well affected to <hi>France;</hi> and that when they were departed, it was to be feared that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might creepe into their places, not well diſpoſed either to the moſt <hi>Chriſtian King</hi> or to the <hi>Republique.</hi> But when at laſt theſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were ſurmounted, and there was ſome hope to effect this Leuie, there hapned in the Month of <hi>September</hi> another hindrance, which was a controuerſie betweene the <hi>Canton</hi> of
<hi>Berne</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Baſil,</hi> vpon an exchange made by them of the land of <hi>Biel</hi> with ſome other: Wherefore being in ſome feare that this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might come to Armes, the <hi>Suiſſes</hi> had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vnto the <hi>Griſons</hi> to be ready for their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, and to depute ſome perſons to goe to the <hi>Diet</hi> which was to bee holden at
<hi>Baden</hi> vpon this matter. Some men imagined that all this was done purpoſely by the Biſhop againſt the <hi>Bernois,</hi> to hinder all Leuies which the <hi>Repub.</hi> intended to make among the
<hi>Suiſſes</hi> or <hi>Griſons:</hi> they were more confirmed in this opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome of the principall of <hi>Lucerne</hi> vſed all
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:17285:168"/> their endeuouis with the <hi>Griſons,</hi> to the end that they ſhould not ſerue againſt the <hi>Pope.</hi> But being aſſembled at <hi>Pithac,</hi> they found by a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinie of voices that the greater part conſented to the Leuie in fauour of the
<hi>Republique</hi> abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and others (the leſſer number) conſented thereto vpon condition that the <hi>Republique</hi> ſhould declare what ſuccours they would giue in recompence when they might be required, and among theſe the principall were they of <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſane.</hi> The cauſe that made the <hi>Griſons</hi> ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, was, the <hi>Archduke Maximilian</hi> Gouernour of <hi>Tirol,</hi> who for to aſſure himſelfe of a ſtrong paſſage, commodious to goe and come, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> would fortifie <hi>Venoſta</hi> whereof he gaue a manifeſt ſigne, by cauſing all the paſſages which deſcend from thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Vale <hi>Camonica</hi> to be ſounded. And the <hi>Count Fuentes</hi> deſigned to make himſelfe Maſter of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> hauing put 200. foot within the ſort, &amp; other 200 in the three Pariſhes, &amp; 200. more paied by the <hi>Eccleſiaſtiques.</hi> But that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> aſſured mens ſuſpition hereof, was an accident very light, which was not accounted an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, conſidering the realouſie where with the ſpirits of men were poſſeſſed: which was, that
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:17285:169"/> ſome ſouldiers being fled from the Fort
<hi>Fuente</hi> retired themſelues into the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> whither being purſued by a Band of others, till within the <hi>State</hi> of the
<hi>Griſons,</hi> there they were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted, which beginning of a breach made men feare worſe. Wherefore they deliberated to ſend <hi>Veſpaſian de Salis</hi> with two others to gouerne the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and to place therein 1800 ſouldiers; and they committed to them of <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadina</hi> &amp; <hi>Poſchiauo</hi> the cuſtodie of the paſſage of
<hi>Bormio,</hi> with purpoſe to put therein 1600 ſouldiers, taken out of thoſe who were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Villages to ſerue in Warre, and 600. in
<hi>Chiauenna,</hi> which was executed in the beginning of this yeere, vpon the occaſions which wee ſhall mention hereafter. They deliberated alſo to ſend <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> and to the <hi>Proteſtant Suiſſes,</hi> to know what ſuccours they might expect from <hi>France,</hi> from the <hi>Repub.</hi> and the
<hi>Suiſſes,</hi> in caſe that any thing ſhould be attempted againſt their Liberty. They purpoſed to ſend to <hi>Venice, Hercules de Salis,</hi> with charge to aſſure the <hi>Republique</hi> of the Leuie, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſuccours. They determined likewiſe to require of the <hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> the reſtitution of the Priſoners, which yet they had no hope to
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:17285:169"/> obtaine; as alſo they made a diſpatch vnto the <hi>Suiſſes</hi> Proteſtants to demand their aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salis</hi> then being arriued at <hi>Venice,</hi> preſented himſelfe vnto the <hi>Duke,</hi> and firſt complained, in the behalfe of his Maſters, of the enterpriſes which the <hi>Pope</hi> made vpon them: then promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the entertainment of the Capitulation; and finally recounted the particular grieuances w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they receiued from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies which they gaue them, affirming that they further menaced them to take the <hi>Valto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line.</hi> He adioyned that they were reſolued not to ſuffer any longer theſe Iniuries, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary that they would enterpriſe to recouer the Fort. That they praied his <hi>Serenitie</hi> to declare what aid they would afford them in this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, which howſoeuer it ſeemed particularly to touch his Maſters, yet it imported haply more the liberty of all <hi>Italy.</hi> He ſaid moreouer, that the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> had declared himſelfe, and that ſome of the <hi>Proteſtant Suiſſes</hi> had imitated the <hi>King,</hi> and others expected what the <hi>Repub.</hi> would do: that the <hi>Catholique Suiſſes</hi> held them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues neutrall. He touched alſo particularly the great preiudice which the <hi>Republique</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, in caſe that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould make
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:17285:170"/> themſelues <hi>Maſters</hi> of the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> or ſhould ſhut vp that paſſage, or finally reduce the there Leagues to the ancient Capitulation. In the end he repeated the reſolution of thoſe Peoples to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer themſelues from all theſe enterpriſes, and perſwaded the <hi>Republique</hi> to reſolue to giue them powerfull Aſſiſtance, alledging the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of many things done by Them to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Liberty of <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The anſwer to this <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> was a thanking of his
<hi>Maſters</hi> for their good affection to the <hi>Republique,</hi> praiſing their reſolution to defend themſelues, with promiſe to obſerue entirely the Treaty made with them, together with the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours agreed vpon in it, aſſuring them that they ſhould haue all ſorts of Aſſiſtance from the <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niory,</hi> and hauing Treated with the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> as Principall in this Buſineſſe, they would further deſcend to particularities.</p>
            <p>But beſides the prouiſions made by the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi> for an Armie by <hi>Sea,</hi> and then Leuy of <hi>Italians,</hi> as we haue ſaid, the <hi>Senate</hi> hauing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the Deſignes of <hi>Count Fuentes,</hi> gaue commandement to their <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> in
<hi>France,</hi> to giue account vnto the <hi>King</hi> of the negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of
<hi>Don Francis de Caſtro,</hi> of the anſwer that
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:17285:170"/> was made him, and of the Order which the
<hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> had receiued by three <hi>Curriers</hi> to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the <hi>Pope;</hi> together with his preparations, and how he had begun with a Leuy of 3000. foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>Italians,</hi> beſides the other of
<hi>Germanes, Suiſſes, Neapolitans</hi> and <hi>Spaniards;</hi> that it ſeemed the <hi>Pope</hi> expecting theſe Forces had ſo often va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, giuing words vnto the <hi>K.</hi> without inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion to keep them, and with deſigne to reuoke them. Wherefore that he ſhould intreat the <hi>King</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelfe, and what the <hi>Republique</hi> might promiſe themſelues from him, in caſe the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould not deale vprightly, which it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary they ſhould know ſpeedily, and that his <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> might tell the <hi>Pope</hi> thereof reſolutely. This was communicated to <hi>Freſne,</hi> who anſwered, that the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Maſter</hi> knew, that the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> ſending <hi>Don Francis de Caſtro</hi> was perſwaded that the <hi>Republique</hi> would deny him nothing, that ſo the agreement might paſſe by his hands; which was the cauſe that the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> had commanded <hi>Alincourt</hi> to ſpeak reſeruedly till he ſhould ſee what were the effects of the Treaty of
<hi>Don Francis.</hi> But now, ſaid <hi>Freſne,</hi> ſince the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> are defeated of their hopes, Hee muſt needs be moued, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:17285:171"/> ſince the <hi>Nuntio</hi> hath complained in
<hi>Spain,</hi> that the <hi>King</hi> hath not fauoured the <hi>Pope,</hi> but only with vaine words; whereupon that <hi>King</hi> ſeeing his Reputation impaired, hath writ to the <hi>Count de Fuentes,</hi> and to his other
<hi>Miniſters</hi> to make prouiſion of Armes, to the end that his
<hi>Holineſſe</hi> might know that he would Aſſiſt him in effect, not only in words. That this reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> being publiſhed to all the World, and the aduice which his <hi>Serenitie</hi> had hereof, being conformable to that which the <hi>Moſt Chriſtian King</hi> had receiued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Spaine,</hi> it ſeemed vnto him now ſeaſonable to vnfold his Commiſſions. And then he ſaid, that the
<hi>King</hi> commanded him to aſſure the <hi>Republique,</hi> that in this occaſion hee would be their good Friend and Brother, as he was obliged to ſhew himſelfe in time of need. And thereof as his <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> hee aſſured them, and promiſed the good will of the <hi>King.</hi> He added further that more then three moneths before he had charge to Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate vnto them another thing, but to do it in ſeaſonable time, which time he thought was now come. And this was; that the <hi>K.</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by good intelligence, that the <hi>Count Fuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> hauing a Deſigne to goe armed into <hi>Paradiſe,</hi>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:17285:171"/> was purpoſed to come into the
<hi>Vicentine</hi> with 1500. horſe, and 10000. foot, and to take ſome places of ſtrength (whereof he knew not the names,) to diuide the
<hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Republique.</hi> That conſequently it was very fit to preuent him, and to kindle the fire firſt in the houſe of an enemie; That his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> on this occaſion propoſed to make the
<hi>Griſons</hi> come downe into the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Milan;</hi> and he declared, that for to Treat this Affaire, <hi>Hercules de Salis</hi> was come to <hi>Venice</hi> not onely with the conſent, but by the commandement of the
<hi>King;</hi> adioyning, that if the <hi>Republique</hi> intended to aſſiſt the <hi>Griſons,</hi> as he exhorted them to doe, the
<hi>King</hi> would openly declare himſelfe in the Difference which they had againſt the <hi>Pope:</hi> but that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the
<hi>Republique</hi> ſhould firſt reſolue with themſelues, before they proceeded to a rupture with the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Wherefore that it was not meet to breake all at once, on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but to gaine time to make preparations, and to receiue Succours; and he beleeued that the Succours were ready for defence of the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> and therefore it was neceſſary that they ſhould declare what aids in particular they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this occaſion. That certainly the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:17285:172"/> could doe no leſſe than ſuſtaine their Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie by force, ſeeing that hauing ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſenſible of the iniuries receiued from the <hi>Pope,</hi> and hauing notwithſtanding condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Fauour of the <hi>Moſt Chriſtian King,</hi> ſo far as they might; if at the preſent they ſhould yeeld any further, it would appeare that they had been conſtant and made great ſhewes, ſo long as men treated by words, but that after the noiſe of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Armies they had baſely relented. And as the <hi>K.</hi> his <hi>Maſter</hi> was obliged, becauſe they had done ſo much in his conſideration, ſo ſhould he be free, if they ſhould doe for others what they would not for him. And to the end that the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> might not reſt doubtfull any longer what was the finall will of the <hi>Pope, Freſne</hi> ſaid hee would clearely reueale it vnto them, and this it was; That his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> would haue the <hi>Kings</hi> word, that the Lawes ſhould not be executed by the <hi>Republique,</hi> and that not by way of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but becauſe his reall intention was that it ſhould be indeed performed, vntill they might further Treat thereof, deſiring to haſten the Treaty vnto a Concluſion, that it be not put off <hi>ad Kalendas Graecas;</hi> That he would examine the Lawes deliberately, with reſolution to haue
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:17285:172"/> them abrogated if they were found vniuſt, but if he found them good and conuenient, he would enioyne the
<hi>Eccleſiaſtiques</hi> by a <hi>Bull</hi> to obſerue them, as made by the <hi>See Apoſtolique,</hi> and not as Lawes of the <hi>Republique,</hi> who could not eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh them: Further, that his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> was firme and conſtant to haue a reſtitution of all the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,</hi> and ſpecially of the <hi>Ieſuites.</hi> Hee ſaid moreouer, that they needed not to deſpaire of an Agreement, if the Treaty were purſued (as it had beene begunne) by the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Maſter,</hi> whoſe Propoſitions were as different from thoſe of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as are thoſe of a Friend and of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, in as much as the <hi>Moſt Chriſtian King</hi> did not enter into this Affaire as obliged vnto the <hi>Pope:</hi> That notwithſtanding it was neceſſary to ſurceaſe the Treaty for a while, ſeeing it could not be continued, but with diſaduantage, the Armies being leuied, and any ſhew of feare would puffe vp the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with pride. But if by their refuſall they did occaſion <hi>Don Francis de Caſtro</hi> to retire, the <hi>King</hi> might then after continue the Treatie, wherein he would imploy himſelfe with affection. And if they imagined the <hi>Pope</hi> might be wonne by faire meanes, hee iudged fit that they ſhould ſignifie all vnto the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:17285:173"/> 
               <hi>King</hi> by ſome expreſſe and capable Perſon. The <hi>Senate</hi> anſwered (thanking the <hi>King</hi> for his good will, and for this Declaration,) that they had not failed to put all in order both in the Territory of <hi>Vicenza,</hi> and in all their
<hi>State:</hi> And that the <hi>Count de Fuentes,</hi> or whoſoeuer ſhould attempt any ſuch enterpriſe, ſhould finde ſtrong and able reſiſtance; That now nothing remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but that it would pleaſe the
<hi>King</hi> to let them ſee what the <hi>Republique</hi> might promiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> in caſe that neceſſitie ſhould force them to breake the Treaty, being ſtill moſt reſolute to maintaine their Libertie and Dignity giuen by God, vntill the laſt breath without the leaſt relenting; which they deſired to know more particularly, conſidering that the Prouiſions made, and ſtill increaſed by the
<hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> required ſome aſſurance; that the
<hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> would powerfully aſſiſt the <hi>Griſons,</hi> and immediately execute what they promiſed, ſo ſoone as they were ſecured of Succour for their owne indemnity, which they muſt be ſpeedily, deſiring to haue that Succour ſpecified, that they might Treat thereof with his <hi>Maieſtie,</hi> which they would doe by meanes of their
<hi>Ambaſſador Priuli,</hi> and if it were needfull they would ſend
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:17285:173"/> an Extraordinary: That touching the Treaties of <hi>Don Francis de Caſtro,</hi> they had communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all that was done to <hi>Freſne</hi> himſelfe, who confeſſed it neceſſary that they muſt giue him an anſwer, which he demanded continually with great inſtance. And it was very true that <hi>Don Francis</hi> often preſented himſelfe, vrging to haue ſome anſwer to his Propoſition.</p>
            <p>For, the Holidaies were no ſooner paſt, but hee appeared in the
<hi>Senate,</hi> ſaying, That his thoughts were ſtill bent on the Agreement, and that he had ſpent already 53. dayes ſince his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuall, during which he might ſay he had done nothing, although he demanded but a very ſmall thing, to wit, a Suſpenſion for ſome time, with which he was aſſured the <hi>Pope</hi> would be contented; That if he would not, the
<hi>Catholique King</hi> would ceaſe to fauour him, who wiſhed indeed the contentment of the Republique, but yet after that of the <hi>Pope;</hi> for whoſe ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when the <hi>Repub.</hi> ſhould haue done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in gratification of his <hi>King,</hi> he would caſt himſelfe at the <hi>Popes</hi> feet, and would not riſe till he had obtained of his
<hi>Holineſſe</hi> ſome Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſatisfaction for the
<hi>Repub.</hi> from whom that did not ſuffice which had beene yeelded in
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:17285:174"/> Fauour of the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>France,</hi> ſince it ſtood not with the Dignity of the <hi>Catholique King</hi> to ſpeak vpon others trauailes, and of things already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected by the <hi>Pope.</hi> That he was not vnwilling therefore to ioyne with the
<hi>French Ambaſſador,</hi> for as much as his <hi>King</hi> refuſed not Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions in this good work, but he deſired to know what kinde of Vnion he might haue with the <hi>French:</hi> that he expected anſwers more cleare and ample than had beene giuen him. That deſiring a good ſucceſſe in this Affaire, he had waited, &amp; would yet wait with patience, but he looked for ſome Declaration of what might be done by vniting himſelfe with the

And if this Propoſition were not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that he would reſolue to take his laſt farewell of his Commiſſion, being already vexed and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſo tedious delayes, by which he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired little Honour. There was not any weeke wherein <hi>Don Francis</hi> did not once at leaſt, but vſually oftner, ſhew himſelfe in <hi>Senate,</hi> with the ſame Propoſition, notwithſtanding that he had
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:17285:174"/> alwaies the ſame Anſwer; becauſe he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements from <hi>Spaine,</hi> rather to preſſe with importunity theſe things, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a whit. As alſo they charged the
<hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> to Arme, but with command not to moue farther wth out new Order, altho he were prouoked by the <hi>Griſons,</hi> or by Others. And becauſe <hi>Don Francis</hi> offering to vnite himſelfe with the
<hi>French,</hi> found not in them ſuch corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence as he expected, he could not containe himſelfe (about the end of <hi>Ianuary)</hi> from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the ſmall reſpect which he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from them; ſaying, That aſſuredly the <hi>Pope</hi> would remoue the
<hi>Cenſures,</hi> prouided that he might haue aſſurance that the Lawes ſhould not be executed; That they might and ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue him herein, as hauing neuer varied in his Treaties. That the Affaire was in great diſorder, becauſe it had not beene ſincerely treated by the <hi>Mediators,</hi> who howſoeuer they pretended a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Peace, yet peraduenture aimed at other ends; which could not be truly affirmed of his <hi>King,</hi> who had as great intereſt in the Repoſe of <hi>Italy,</hi> as the <hi>Repub.</hi> That hauing ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propoſed theſe things to the <hi>Senate,</hi> it ſeemed to him high time for them to returne him an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>

<hi>Ambaſſador Priuli</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vnto the <hi>King</hi> that which the <hi>Senate</hi> had giuen him in charge, that it would pleaſe his
<hi>Maieſtie</hi> to declare him. himſelfe. He anſwered, that it was yet not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to doe it, to the end that neither partie ſhould perſeuere in their ſtiffeneſſe: That he had receiued Letters from all the
<hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Italie</hi> and other <hi>Grandies,</hi> who praied him to ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour a concluſion of theſe Debates: propoſing vnto him, that as the ſucceſſe herein could not but aduance his Glory, ſo to retire himſelfe ſhould be to draw vpon him the fault of all ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter effects which might follow. Therefore, that he had diſpatched a commandement to the
<hi>Cardinall de Ioyeuſe</hi> to paſſe into <hi>Italy,</hi> and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to interpoſe in this buſineſſe. To which the
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> replied, hauing commended the good will of the
<hi>King</hi> to Peace, that there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared little correſpondence in the
<hi>Pope,</hi> who
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:17285:175"/> prided himſelfe in the promiſes of the

<hi>Republique</hi> at the inſtance of his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> were diſpoſed to aſſiſt the <hi>Griſons.</hi> Here the <hi>King</hi> ſaid, that in aſſiſting the <hi>Griſons</hi> the <hi>Repub.</hi> ſhould doe themſelues a good ſeruice, both to conſerue the amitie of that Nation, &amp; to keep the paſſage open: That <hi>Freſne</hi> had no commiſſion from him to come to particulars: That he knew no what he had ſaid or promiſed, but He vnderſtood himſelfe not to be obliged: And further he ſaw clearely, that to declare himſelfe were nothing elſe but to looſe his Authority with the <hi>Pope,</hi> but of that he would make anſwer more particularly by <hi>Villeroy.</hi> Who after told him from the
<hi>King,</hi> that his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> hauing a good hope of the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, leſt hee ſhould interrupt or trouble the Treaty (ſo long as any point thereof was a foot) he would not declare himſelfe: That for this reaſon he had writ to the <hi>Card. de Ioyeuſe</hi> that he ſhould ſpeedily goe to <hi>Venice,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Rome;</hi> in the meane while he would write to his <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> that he ſhould proceed
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:17285:176"/> with efficacie: And conformably to this he had giuen order to <hi>Freſne</hi> to tell the <hi>Venetians:</hi> That the
<hi>King</hi> had certaine aduice, that on the <hi>Popes</hi> part there was not any difficultie touching the promiſes, and that with theſe conditions men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, all Controuerſies might be accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated, to wit, That the Priſoners ſhould be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered into the hands of an
<hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſarie: That an <hi>Ambaſſ.</hi> ſhould be ſent towards the <hi>Pope,</hi> who being come to a place appointed, the <hi>Pope</hi> would take away the <hi>Cenſures,</hi> as alſo the ſame day at <hi>Venice</hi> they ſhould take away the Proteſtation; and this being done, the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador</hi> ſhould continue his iourney, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued at <hi>Rome</hi> according to the ordinary cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, being not withſtanding accompanied to the firſt Audience by
<hi>Alincourt.</hi> And becauſe the <hi>Pope</hi> wiſhed the <hi>Kings</hi> word that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi> ſhould not vſe their Lawes, the
<hi>King</hi> was ready and deſired to giue it, ſo that the
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi> by ſome ſigne would giue conſent, to aſſure him that his word ſhould be executed: That for the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> he beleeued the thing to be without difficultie, howſoeuer the <hi>King</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the <hi>Ambaſſador Priuli</hi> had found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in great reſiſtance, and a ſtronger reſolution
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:17285:176"/> then his <hi>Maieſtie</hi> expected, ſo far that <hi>Priuli</hi> ſaid, that ſometimes the <hi>Republique</hi> had had all the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi> banded againſt them, yet had not deſpaired nor had beene willing therefore to do themſelues any preiudice: That neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he hoped not to finde ſo great reſiſtance from his <hi>Serenitie,</hi> but that in gratification of his
<hi>Maieſtie</hi> they would conſent to theſe two Points. The
<hi>Duke,</hi> conſidering the preiudices which would come of theſe two things, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately anſwered, That this were to make the world beleeue that the <hi>Republique</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſome fault; That it was a means to make them of <hi>Rome</hi> inſolent, and giue them occaſion to conceiue Pretenſions aboue all <hi>Princes,</hi> if they ſhould thus carry the matter againſt the <hi>Republique.</hi> That the Priſoners had beene giuen to the <hi>King,</hi> and to him it appertained to doe with them as he pleaſed: But the <hi>Republique</hi> could doe nothing more, and would neuer conſent to ſend an <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> before the <hi>Pope,</hi> by reuoking the <hi>Cenſures,</hi> had ſatisfied for the iniuries. That the offences receiued from the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> were too exceſſiue, and of too great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, hauing inſtigated the <hi>Pope,</hi> and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the
<hi>Republique</hi> throughout all <hi>Chriſtian
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:17285:177"/> States:</hi> That it was not meet to reeſtabliſh their Enemies after the example of others, and if others had ſometime done it, they had beene gouerned therein by their Intereſts, different fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe of the <hi>Repub.</hi> That euery one knowes what is fit for his owne particular, and what is done in one <hi>Eſtate</hi> is not therefore meet to be executed in all. For the <hi>Cardinall de Ioyeuſe</hi> if he came he ſhould be very welcome and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly entertained, but they much more deſired that hee ſhould turne himſelfe towards <hi>Rome,</hi> where his employment was much more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to reduce the <hi>Pope</hi> to point of reaſon: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Republique</hi> hauing yeelded all that they could, there was no more to be done, but at <hi>Rome,</hi> where the remainder ought to bee Treated.</p>
            <p>By all theſe Treaties it appeared that the <hi>Pope</hi> was little inclined to any Concord, vnleſſe it might be with his great aduantage, eſpecially ſeeing the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to continue their warlike prouiſions. But aboue all he gaue a manifeſt ſigne of a minde vtterly auerſe from Peace, when he declared the day of <hi>Ianuary</hi> in full <hi>Conſiſtorie,</hi> that he would haue Warre with the
<hi>Republique</hi> of <hi>Venice;</hi> That to this effect he had
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:17285:177"/> from the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi>
26000. foot, and 4000. horſe, and named the <hi>Cardinall Borgheſe</hi> his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew to be his <hi>Legate</hi> with 1000. Crownes a Moneth for prouiſion. This declaration of the <hi>Pope</hi> ioyned to the preparations of the
<hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> were little pleaſing to the <hi>Princes</hi> of
<hi>Italy,</hi> and particularly to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> the great <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and to the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Mantua;</hi> who conſidered very prudently, how much it imported, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had ſo great forces in <hi>Italy,</hi> and that the
<hi>Pope</hi> had caſt himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely into their hands. The
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Sauoy</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued it ſo much more iealouſly, becauſe he had beene iutreated by the <hi>Count Fuentes</hi> to fill vp his companies of horſe, to receiue within his Countrey ſome of his Troupes, and to put in his hands the Fortreſſe of <hi>Carbonara,</hi> to hinder the
<hi>Huguenots</hi> of <hi>France</hi> to paſſe vnto the ſuccour of the
<hi>Venetians:</hi> giuing his word that ſo ſoone as the
<hi>Republique</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> ſhould be vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed (which hee ſaid would be within three Moneths,) hee would withdraw his ſouldiers and leaue the Countrey free; wherewith the <hi>Duke</hi> was much grieued, and complained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in <hi>Spaine.</hi> And the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Mantua</hi> being required to lodge the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> within
<hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,</hi>
               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:17285:178"/> excuſed himſelfe not only vnto the
<hi>Count</hi> but alſo to the <hi>King:</hi> who ſent order to
<hi>Milan</hi> that the <hi>Duke</hi> ſhould not be preſſed. But to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the courſe of theſe diſorders, the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Sauoy</hi> Treated with the <hi>Pope</hi> by the <hi>Count de Verüa</hi> his <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> that he would ioyne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the great <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and that they would put together good forces to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour him: and on the other ſide, the ſame
<hi>Duke</hi> ſignified to the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> the offers which he had made vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> proteſting that he made them not to offend the <hi>Republique,</hi> or to ſtrengthen the <hi>Pope</hi> further for the Warre, but to the end that the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould not wholly caſt himſelfe into the hands of <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Pope</hi> did not take in good part this
<hi>Ambaſſage</hi> of the <hi>Count de Verüa:</hi> on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he maruailed that his <hi>Maſter</hi> did not ioy ne his intention with the
<hi>Spaniards.</hi> Wherefore he began to ſuſpect his iourney to
<hi>Venice,</hi> and wiſhed him to conſider that for the obſtinacie (ſo he ſpake) of the <hi>Venetians</hi> nothing could be done, and therefore exhorted him not to hazard ſo his reputation.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Spaine</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lerma</hi> complained to the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of <hi>England</hi> of the Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:17285:178"/> of aſſiſtance which his <hi>King</hi> had made in fauour of the <hi>Republique,</hi> ſaying, that they had not ſhewed themſelues ſo reſolute againſt the <hi>Pope,</hi> if they had not been encouraged by his <hi>King;</hi> becauſe from <hi>France</hi> they could expect nothing but words, or peraduenture ſome Troupes hired with their owne ſiluer. He ſaid alſo that the <hi>King</hi> his Maſter oppoſed himſelfe to the Treaty of Peace with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> to enfeeble ſo much the more the Succours which the <hi>Pope</hi> might otherwiſe haue from <hi>Spaine:</hi> but that the <hi>Catholique King</hi> would abandon all other enterpriſes to increaſe his power for the maintenance of Religion: That not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he hoped to be able for the ſeruice of <hi>God</hi> to doe both the one and the other, making rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy 50000. ſouldiers which would ſuffice both for <hi>Italy</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries:</hi> That he would leuie 45. Companies of foot to ſend into <hi>Italie</hi> vnder <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Toledo:</hi> That he would draw the men of Warre out of
<hi>Sicily, Naples,</hi> and <hi>Milan,</hi> and gather more out of
<hi>Germanie</hi> and <hi>Suiſſerland,</hi> being reſolued not to aband on the <hi>Pope:</hi> That he would haue the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>Great-Britaine</hi> vnderſtand, that the aide which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the
<hi>Republique</hi> ſhould be to ſmall
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:17285:179"/> purpoſe, foraſmuch as they had not forces an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to report: That their great treaſure was a brag: That their ſubiects were diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and deſirous to change the Gouernment. That the <hi>Signiory</hi> had no Captaines of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>Catholique King</hi> hauing with him all the <hi>Italian Princes,</hi> vnleſſe they had recourſe to ſome hereticall <hi>Prince,</hi> which would render them odious both to the People and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. All this was ſpoken, to the end that the <hi>Republique,</hi> ſeeing themſelues forſaken by all, ſhould yeeld more eaſily to that which the <hi>Pope</hi> deſired.</p>
            <p>Now at <hi>Venice</hi> men beleeued for certaine, that the Differences with <hi>Rome</hi> could not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of any Concord, and that the preſent yeere would not paſſe with ſuch tranquillitie as the former had enioyned, which was wholly ſpent in Treaties and Diſputes. Which they feared ſo much the more, becauſe the Leuies of men of Warre within the
<hi>State</hi> of <hi>Milan</hi> euery day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. And though ſome imagined vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly (as alſo the euent afterward ſhewed,) that all this was done to no other end then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine the <hi>Republique</hi> onely for feare to yeeld vnto the <hi>Popes</hi> demands, or rather by theſe
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:17285:179"/> apparences to giue him content or to oblige him farther; not withſtanding this produced a contrary effect in the ſpirits of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who reſolued to haſten with more courage the preparations of Warre, and to make ready all their Troupes,
<hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Albans,</hi> with ſome others of the
<hi>Vltramontans.</hi> They determined alſo to elect a <hi>Secretary</hi> to be ſent to the <hi>Count de Vaudemont,</hi> as well to giue the firſt pay to the ſouldiers, as to write vnto him that he was to begin the Leuie: and they elected <hi>Iohn Baptista Padauin,</hi> who had beene employed to the ſame effect in the yeere 1601. who had Commiſſion to make a Leuie of
6000. foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to wit, 3000. <hi>French, Lorraines</hi> and <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons,</hi> and 3000. <hi>Dutch,</hi> although afterwards hee had commandement to let the
<hi>Dutch</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and to leuie 3000. naturall <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> to whom hee was inioyned by the way to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the Differences of the
<hi>Republique,</hi> and the occaſions which they had to make vſe of their Nation; and in particular hee had charge to doe theſe offices at <hi>Zurich, Baſil</hi> and <hi>Berne,</hi> without lingring, that hee might quickly paſſe to <hi>Nancy,</hi> which was the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall aime of his iourney.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:17285:180"/> 
               <hi>Verdelli</hi> being ſtill at
<hi>Venice,</hi> where he had beene ſince <hi>Aprill</hi> of the former yeare, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to let him know, that if the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies with the <hi>Pope</hi> paſſed on further, the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi> ſhould haue need to ſerue themſelues of men beyond the <hi>Mountaines;</hi> and therefore that he ſhould aduertiſe the <hi>Count de Vaudemont</hi> his
<hi>Maſter,</hi> to take ſo good order with his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, that he might on all occaſions cauſe to paſſe into <hi>Italy</hi> ſuch numbers of Souldiers, as the <hi>Republique</hi> ſhould require for their ſeruice.
<hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delli</hi> anſwered, that the men were ready, and that they ſhould be more troubled to retaine them that were ſuperfluous, than to ſend them that were required: That for the paſſage, the <hi>Count</hi> his
<hi>Maſter</hi> would let them paſſe ſecurely by the way of the
<hi>Suiſſes</hi> and <hi>Griſons.</hi> And hee ſaid moreouer, that it was fit to giue aduice to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorraine</hi> touching the occurrences and ſtate of the Buſineſſe, and that he would take it as a ſingular fauour, Which accordingly the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> executed ſpeedily, commanding their <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador,</hi> who was with the <hi>Moſt Chriſtian King,</hi> to ſend to <hi>Lorraine,</hi> and to ſignifie vnto thoſe <hi>Princes</hi> the ſtate of the <hi>Republique,</hi> to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance of their moſt iuſt Reaſons, and the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:17285:180"/> wrongs which they had ſuffered by the
<hi>Pope:</hi> and to let that <hi>Count</hi> vnderſtand, that he ſhould prouide things neceſſary, to the end that when the time ſhould require, and when the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> ſhould giue him notice, he might be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to tranſport Souldiers which ſhould bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Ambaſſ.</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> in <hi>France</hi> receiued this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, the <hi>Count de Vaudemont</hi> was at
<hi>Paris</hi> with the <hi>King,</hi> to aduiſe him of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bar</hi> his Brother, with the Daughter of the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Mantua:</hi> wherefore the <hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> had opportunity to aduertiſe him according to his charge. To which he anſwered that the Reaſons of the <hi>Republique</hi> were full of honeſty, and the inſtances of the <hi>Pope</hi> very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, and that he would not faile to ſend ſuch numbers of Souldiers as were required. The
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> alſo ſent to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorraine</hi> the <hi>Secretary Dominico Dominici,</hi> who being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued the ſecond of
<hi>Iune</hi> at <hi>Nancy,</hi> communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the <hi>Duke</hi> what had paſſed between the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Republique,</hi> and the great Reaſons which vrged the <hi>Republique</hi> to maintaine their Lawes, and their ancient Authority to iudge the <hi>Eccleſiaſtiques.</hi> The
<hi>Duke</hi> teſtified, that he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:17285:181"/> gratefully the Honour which the
<hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> had done him in this Communication, and inlarged himſelfe amply in the praiſes of their Prudence, and of their Religion; adioyning for the particulars of the matters in diſpute, that if the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> his Sonne would make purchaſes within his Lands without his permiſſion, he would not endure it. And for iudging
<hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiques,</hi> he ſaid, That it was practiſed in his
<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,</hi> and in all <hi>France:</hi> and as it was meet for them to ſurpaſſe others in innocence, ſo ought they ſo much more to be reſtrained to right courſes by feare of paines. Touching the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers which they deſired, he anſwered that the <hi>Count</hi> his Sonne was at the Seruice of the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> as alſo all his horſe ſhould be ready to the ſame purpoſe. Thus all things remained till the beginning of
<hi>October,</hi> at which time the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were rendered in gratification to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> but the <hi>Republique</hi> ſeeing that what they had done, did not produce any good effect, they gaue order a new to the <hi>Ambaſſ.</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> to ſend his Secretary into
<hi>Lorraine,</hi> to giue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count vnto the <hi>Duke</hi> of the ſtate of their affaires, of the <hi>Popes</hi> obſtinacy, and that if things paſſed further, the <hi>Republique</hi> ſhould be conſtrained
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:17285:181"/> to prouide Souldiers beyond the
<hi>Mountaines.</hi> The <hi>Duke</hi> exhorted the <hi>Republique</hi> by many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to an agreement, adding neuertheleſſe that in caſe of a rupture he would performe what he had promiſed, beleeuing the <hi>Count</hi> to be of the ſame minde; with whom the <hi>Secretary</hi> (who was
<hi>Chriſtopher Suriano)</hi> did not Communicate becauſe he was then in
<hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the ſtate of things vntill <hi>Ianuary</hi> of this preſent yeare, when in the vniuerſall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of all the

            <p>The <hi>Secretary Padauin</hi> paſſing by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of the
<hi>Griſons,</hi> (which he found all in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion for feare of the

<hi>Zurich,</hi> who manifeſted their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conſent both to the Leuy, and to giue paſſage, ſaying, That they had prohibited their people to goe to any Warre, not with purpoſe to oppoſe the demands of
<hi>France</hi> or <hi>Venice,</hi> but to the end that they might not goe for the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> of <hi>Friburg</hi> againſt that of <hi>Berne,</hi> about a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference moued by the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> betweene thoſe two

            <p>But at <hi>Baſil</hi> he receiued a very fauourable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from the <hi>Counſell</hi> as touching the Leuie, but for the paſſage it was told him, that it was meet to expect the returne of the Deputies from

               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:17285:183"/> they ought to haue the conſent of their Allies before they ſuffered any forreine Souldiers to enter.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Soloturn</hi> a Gentleman appeared in the Name of the

<hi>Heluetia</hi> and their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, principally for his <hi>Eſtates</hi> of <hi>Alſatia,</hi> by which they of <hi>Lorraine</hi> muſt paſſe. This inſtance was fauoured by the <hi>Catholique Cantons,</hi> and eſpecially with great heat by the Sonne of the <hi>Colonell Luſi</hi> of
<hi>Vnder walden,</hi> who had beene diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed by the

<hi>Proteſtant Cantons</hi> oppoſed themſelues, ſaying, that it was not the Cuſtome of that Nation to deny paſſage to thoſe who would not any way endamage the Countrey, or bring preiudice to their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours or Friends: On the contrary, that without danger or trouble the <hi>Lorraines</hi> might paſſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly without inſolence, and without Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buzes, being no way reaſonable to forbid them paſſage, ſeeing it had beene yeelded two yeares

<hi>Cardinall</hi> was the cauſe, who for his Intereſts was a Partiſan of
<hi>Rome.</hi> All theſe diſcourſes did not ſatisfie <hi>Padauin;</hi> wherefore <hi>Verdelli</hi> reſolued himſelfe to go in poſt to
<hi>Nancy,</hi> from whence he would write for him to come, and that he would come to meet him; as he did in the Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ach of the <hi>Duke,</hi> and told him that he ſhould be very

<hi>Verdelli</hi> further declared to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauin,</hi> how the <hi>Pope</hi> had writ a <hi>Breue</hi> vnto the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> wherein he charged him to command <hi>Frier Verdellia</hi> Knight of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> of
<hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> that he ſhould not make any leuie of men for the
<hi>Republique</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> who were refractarie to his commandements, which the <hi>Cardinall</hi> had intimated vnto him, ſetting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes his owne intereſts, and thoſe of his Fraternity. And that
<hi>Mounſieur de Maliana</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a Chamberlaine of the
<hi>Popes,</hi> offered him the firſt vacant <hi>Commendam</hi> to make him deſiſt from his enterpriſes. But that he anſwered, that ſeeing he leuied not men for to command them, nor at his owne expence, he might doe it without ſcruple. <hi>Padauin</hi> alſo had aduice at <hi>Nancy,</hi> that the <hi>Canton</hi> of <hi>Zurich</hi> had granted the paſſage, and the Leuie abſolutely, declaring the Cauſe of the <hi>Republique</hi> to be as iuſt, as that of the <hi>Pope</hi> vniuſt and violent. Likewiſe that
<hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Berne</hi> had freely granted the paſſage without condition, and for the Leuie they had done the ſame, only reſeruing to ſpeake with him
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:17285:185"/> by word of mouth to conſult about ſecuritie for the payment of ſtipends and touching the conditions, according to the cuſtome of that Nation, who will not admit of
<hi>Captaines</hi> but onely ſuch as are Natiues of their Countrey.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Padauin</hi> had Audience of the <hi>Count de Vaude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> and declared his Commiſſion, reporting vnto him what he had Treated with them of <hi>Zurich</hi> and the other <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> and gaue him to vnderſtand that the money was ready for the Leuies, and that now nothing wanted but to come to execution. The <hi>Count</hi> anſwerd coldly that he would doe his duty, and take care to Treat the other particulars, but he praied him to conſider that he was onely a Sonne in the Family, and that he depended vpon his Father, with whom it was neceſſarie firſt to ſpeake. The
<hi>Secretary</hi> replied that he had order ſo to doe; and two daies after hee had Audience of the <hi>Duke,</hi> and ſaid vnto him in the firſt place, that the <hi>Republique</hi> did well accept the ſending of
<hi>Marinuille,</hi> and the zeale which he had ſhewed to publique Tranquillity, from which the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi> was neuer auerſe; but that the Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the <hi>Pope</hi> and of others in his fauour, conſtrained them to doe the ſame for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation.
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:17285:185"/> The <hi>Duke</hi> anſwered, that he had ſent <hi>Marinnille</hi> with good intention, and that it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him well that he was accepted: He exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to Peace, and ſaid, That he was buſied about the Aſſembly of the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> to be holden at <hi>Nancy,</hi> in ſuch ſort that he had not leaſure to thinke vpon any other particular Affaires. <hi>Padauin</hi> did alſo his complements to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bar;</hi> and requiring the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> to giue him Audience, he anſwered, That he would willingly heare him if he would Treat how to end theſe Controuerſies, but for ſimple Complements he could not admit them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Dignity of
<hi>Cardinall</hi> which he had, and leſt it might giue occaſion of Diſcourſe. The <hi>Cardinall</hi> vpon this occaſion diſpatched a
<hi>Currier</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> giuing aduice of the comming of
<hi>Secretary Padauin,</hi> and of the quantitie of ſiluer which he brought, together with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiues which were made in diuers places, as alſo the anſwer which <hi>Verdelli</hi> had giuen him. <hi>Padauin</hi> knew well the great inſtances which the <hi>Count</hi> had from diuers Perſons, to hinder him from ſeruing the <hi>Republique</hi> in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. The
<hi>Pope</hi> alſo had renewed his Inſtances by other <hi>Breues,</hi> complaining that a Sonne of
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:17285:186"/> the Houſe of <hi>Lorraine</hi> would take Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Church</hi> to maintaine Rebels in their obſtinacie, eſpecially hauing no obligation to this Seruice, the ſeuen yeeres being now expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red during which he had obliged himſelfe. He offered him further to make him <hi>Confalonier</hi> (that is, chiefe Standard-bearer,) of the
<hi>Church</hi> beyond the <hi>Mounts</hi> (a new title, which coſt the
<hi>Pope</hi> nothing.)</p>
            <p>The great <hi>Ducheſſe</hi> his Siſter writ vnto him, that he ſhould not, by ſeruing in fauour of the <hi>Republique,</hi> cauſe in the end a Warre damage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Friends and preiudiciall to all
<hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome:</hi> putting him in minde that he had but one Soule, and that he ought to doe any thing to ſaue it, and not to loſe it: That hee ſhould take good heed how he thruſt himſelfe ſo far forward that after he could not retire himſelfe That he would not be the cauſe of combuſtion in <hi>Italy,</hi> it being much better for him to reſtore all that he had receiued of the <hi>Republique,</hi> then to enrangle, himſelfe ſo dangerouſly. And the <hi>Card.</hi> to obtaine from the <hi>Pope</hi> certaine <hi>Benefires</hi> at which he aimed, did all he could in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and was inſtant with the <hi>Duke</hi> his Father, that it was not for his good that the <hi>Count</hi>
               <pb n="345" facs="tcp:17285:186"/> ſhould beare Armes againſt the
<hi>Pope:</hi> That the <hi>Republique</hi> could not complaine, foraſmuch as by the nomination of <hi>Captaines</hi> he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſufficient reputation to their Affaires: That it behoued not to paſſe any further, but onely to imploy himſelfe for a Concord, as did all other <hi>Princes.</hi> Beſides, the Gouernours of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatia</hi> writ that they had order not to giue paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to any ſouldiers: an oppoſition of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſince they might haue a thouſand other paſſages.</p>
            <p>Among the <hi>Griſons</hi> things paſſed with great confuſion, becauſe the <hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> on the one ſide, and thoſe of the <hi>County</hi> of <hi>Tirol</hi> on the other, continued to giue them great occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of iealouſie; ſeattering a rumor that they would inuade the <hi>Valtoline</hi> in three places: with thoſe of
<hi>Milan</hi> by the Lake, with thoſe of <hi>Tirol</hi> by the Valley of the Sunne, and of <hi>Trentin</hi> by <hi>Bormio;</hi> and they had already remoued the <hi>Monks</hi> out of ſome <hi>Monaſteries</hi> within theſe paſſages to make room for lodging of ſouldiers. Whereupon <hi>Salis</hi> at <hi>Venice</hi> continued his ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations, that the <hi>Repub.</hi> would giue them effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall ſuccours; aſſuring them that they could not maintaine thoſe Garriſons ſo neceſſarie to
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:17285:187"/> preſerue the <hi>Valtoline</hi> for themſelues, and the paſſage for the <hi>Republique,</hi> vnleſſe they had ſome pay: That the ſouldiers placed in the <hi>Valtolins</hi> were for the ſeruice of the <hi>Signiory,</hi> and therefore ought to haue pay from them: That there wanted more money to erect a Counterfort to that of
<hi>Fuentes.</hi> The dangers were not indeed ſo great as they were repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but they were thus amplified to draw ſiluer from the
<hi>Republique,</hi> and the 1800. footmen put in the <hi>Valtoline</hi> vnder the conduct of 12. Captaines were all good ſouldiers, but ſuch as could not well be truſted being of the Dioceſſe of <hi>Como,</hi> and being corrupted by ſome writings publiſhed by that <hi>Biſhop.</hi> This notwithſtanding, vpon the preſſing importunitie of <hi>Salis,</hi> the
<hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> decreed to giue for the payment of theſe Garriſons 27000. Crownes for nine Moneths, 3000 for each Month, and to lay downe for the preſent in hand 6000. for two Moneths; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Salis</hi> being not content, and vrging for a greater ſumme, hee receiued to the ſumme of
10000. Crownes: and it was told him, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the erection of a Fort, they had not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined for the time or place: But if things came to a manifeſt rupture, the <hi>Republique</hi>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:17285:187"/> would not faile to giue all neceſſarie aſſiſtance. And when <hi>Salis</hi> preſſed further to haue declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion what ſuccours they intended, two <hi>Senators</hi> of the
<hi>Colledge</hi> were deputed to Treat with him, and to vnderſtand the particular ſtate of things and their neceſſities. But, as it hapneth often, that they are ſurpriſed with terror who meane to terrifie others, the <hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> hearing of the deſcent of the
<hi>Griſons</hi> into the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and conſidering how eaſie it was (if they had any numbers) to ouer-run all the <hi>Eſtate</hi> which was without defence and vnprouided of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, he ſent the
<hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Como,</hi> and writ to the <hi>Duke Sfondrato,</hi> and to the <hi>Count Ptolomy Gallio</hi> to be prepared for all euents: Hee colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ſome Payſants about the number of 7000. without Armes and ill ſouldiers, the conduct of which he gaue to the Gouernour of <hi>Lodi,</hi> not without the diſcontentment of the <hi>Marquis,</hi> of the <hi>Duke,</hi> and of the <hi>Count,</hi> and other perſons of qualitie in the Countrey: Hee ſent them Drums &amp; Enſignes to diſcipline them, with the wonder of all men, that againſt all Rules of Policie he would put Armes into the hands of Payſants, the Allies &amp; Kinſmen of thoſe againſt whom hee would employ them, and ſuch as
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:17285:188"/> were not entirely affected to the
<hi>Spaniards. Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes</hi> thought alſo to put ſome diuiſion among the
<hi>Griſons</hi> vnder pretext of Religion, ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring to ſeduce the
<hi>Catholiques,</hi> and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing they ſhould ſerue vnder the pay of the <hi>Pope;</hi> which produced a cleane contrary effect, becauſe the
<hi>Griſons</hi> were ſo much the more ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious. And by the permiſſion of <hi>Card. Borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meo</hi> he brought to <hi>Milan</hi> the Preacher of <hi>Barga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glia</hi> a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> to Treat with them of that Quarter, ſome <hi>Griſons</hi> (traytors vnto their Countrey) promiſing that he ſhould obtaine a Leuie, which moued a ſedition, and being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in <hi>Pitae</hi> at the end of <hi>February,</hi> they made ſome difficultie touching the Leuie and paſſage for the
<hi>Republique.</hi> But when the newes came from <hi>Venice</hi> of the moneys granted, the ſecret <hi>Counſell</hi> were very thankfull, and all thoſe that were at <hi>Pitac,</hi> euen they that had been moſt oppoſite, conſented to the Leuie and to the paſſage. Notwithſtanding the
<hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> did not ceaſe to doe Offices for
<hi>Spaine</hi> with all the <hi>Catholiques,</hi> euen in his Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, aſſuming to himſelfe this colour, that they ought not to goe againſt the <hi>Church,</hi> or to abandon their Countrey. Inſomuch that hee preuailed with
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:17285:188"/> them of <hi>Longatiſſa</hi> and of
<hi>Viſilis,</hi> which for the greater part were <hi>Catholiques:</hi> whereunto the friends of the <hi>Republique</hi> did not oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues as it was meet, hoping that the more theſe broyles increaſed, they ſhould obtaine the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſummes of money. Whence grew new tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, which were pacified by <hi>Vincenti</hi> Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the <hi>Repub.</hi> giuing ſome Donatiues to the <hi>Pitac,</hi> which was done in the beginning of
<hi>March.</hi> Yet the <hi>Biſhop</hi> did not ceaſe to continue his euill practiſes againſt the <hi>Republique,</hi> as well in his Preaching as vpon all other occaſions that were offered; ſo that a new tumult was raiſed in ſome <hi>Catholique Cantons,</hi> who preſſed the Garriſon of the
<hi>Valtoline</hi> to ſend backe the money to <hi>Venice,</hi> with hope that if they deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded 20000. Crownes by the Moneth they ſhould haue them. Wherefore the Garriſon ſent to tell the Chiefe of the <hi>Leagues</hi> that they would not permit either Leuie or paſſage vnto the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> if they did not augment their wages, ſeeing that vpon their occaſions all theſe diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were in their Coutrey: That the <hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> would not moue, if he were aſſured that paſſage ſhould not be granted to ſouldiers from beyond the <hi>Mountaines</hi> to come into
<hi>Italie.</hi>
               <pb n="350" facs="tcp:17285:189"/> They ſent alſo ſouldiers among the Commons, to diſplay their Enſignes for a common Vnion, and to hinder the paſſage: with whom ioyned the fauourers of <hi>Spaine,</hi> who with their ſiluer fomented the Sedition, proteſting vnto the Heads of the
<hi>Leagues</hi> that they would call the Commons at their owne charge, in caſe they would not hinder the Leuie: for which cauſe they ſent to the
<hi>Captaines</hi> choſen by the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> that they ſhould not diſplay their Enſignes or paſſe any further, whereupon the Captaines made complaint to the <hi>Secretary Vincenti</hi> by reaſon of the expences made in earneſt money and in victuals. But <hi>Vincenti,</hi> who had receiued money from <hi>Venice</hi> for the Leuie, appeaſed them, by diſtributing among them ſome ſmall part. The Companies began to be aſſembled, and the firſt was that of <hi>Coutenalt,</hi> who being about
200. men preſented themſelues before <hi>Coira,</hi> where the Citie being not willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them, they ſtaied without expecting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For which reaſon the <hi>Secretary Vincenti</hi> who was without the Citie retired himſelfe into it, as he was counſelled. From day to day the Sedition increaſed, other Companies arriuing, and being to the number of 800. men, they
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:17285:189"/> made inſtance to be admitted into the Citie, which was granted to auoid further miſchiefe, the Citie ſtanding ſtill vpon their guard.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Preachers</hi> which were among theſe Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiners did all ſorts of good offices, but the Biſh. of <hi>Coira</hi> and the Adherents of
<hi>Spaine</hi> trauelled contrarily. The Miniſters of the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> and of the <hi>Republique</hi> ſent money to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to moue them againſt the Mutiners, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring alſo to appeaſe the Principall amongſt them with ſiluer, but the rage of the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſo great that they preuailed nothing. They of <hi>Agnadina</hi> and <hi>Poſchiauo</hi> kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues free from Sedition, which ſufficed to keepe the paſſage open. And thoſe of the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toline,</hi> repenting themſelues, were reduced to their duty, and a large Trench was begun, whereof the Ouer-ſeers were <hi>Captaine Long</hi> a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and an Ingenier of <hi>Count Francis Martinengo.</hi> The 24. of <hi>March</hi> was called a <hi>Pitac</hi> at <hi>Coira,</hi> where the <hi>Secretary Vincenti</hi> gaue particular account of the Prouiſions w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the
<hi>Republique</hi> had ordained. The Agent of <hi>France</hi> promiſed in the Name of the <hi>King,</hi> to giue 7000. Crownes a Moneth for the Garriſon of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and that he would build a Fort
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:17285:190"/> at his owne charge, and pay the Garriſon of a if he might appoint the Captaine, which ſhould be one of that Countrey.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Rome</hi> they had certaine aduice that the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> by meanes of <hi>Caumartin</hi> his <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador</hi> in
<hi>Suiſſerland,</hi> had demanded in the <hi>Diet</hi> of
<hi>Soloturn,</hi> a Leuie of 10000. <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> with little contentment of that Nation; becauſe the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> had not named either Time or Place or the Captaine, nor disburſed one ſole denier, nor declared where they were to ſerue, but only had ſaid, that he muſt goe to
<hi>Paris,</hi> and that <hi>Monſieur de Refuge</hi> his Succeſſor would come with things neceſſary for the Expedition. There were who thought (conſidering theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances) that the <hi>Moſt Chriſtian King</hi> had no intention to make this Leuie, but only to hinder the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> that they might not obtaine ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Some alſo gaue a more ſiniſter interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this Purſuit, ſaying that he did it to the end that their Friends might not haue men from thence, vnleſſe they acknowledged it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<hi>French</hi> footmen, and 4000 horſe, the <hi>Pope,</hi> although he nothing miſtruſted the <hi>King,</hi> was greatly troubled: and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:17285:190"/> that he ſhed teares vpon it, becauſe he ſaw well it was to hinder the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> leſt he ſhould employ himſelfe for his ſuccour as hee deſired. Wherefore weighing theſe encounters, and hauing conſidered the iourney of the
<hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Padauin</hi> beyond the <hi>Mounts,</hi> he reſolued ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to intend the Agreement, and ſollicited the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> that he would not abandon the Treaty, and that he would to this purpoſe moue the <hi>Card. de Ioyeuſe.</hi> It is true, that the
<hi>K.</hi> of <hi>France</hi> ſo ſoone as he had notice that <hi>Don Francis de Caſtro</hi> was ſent from <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way reſolued to ſend an Extraordinary, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny principall men of that Kingdome were put in conſideration to be employed about this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire: but the <hi>King</hi> very prudently made choiſe of the perſon of this
<hi>Cardinall,</hi> as well becauſe of his excellent qualities, as for that he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and a Confident of the other
<hi>Princes,</hi> who had interpoſed for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing of theſe Troubles; and further becauſe being an <hi>Eccleſiaſtique</hi> by qualitie, and one of the prime in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> he might not onely be a Mediator for the Compoſition, but alſo a Miniſter in the execution of it, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it came to paſſe. The <hi>Cardinall</hi> being on
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:17285:191"/> his way, the mindes of men were in ſuſpence whether he would goe to <hi>Rome</hi> or to <hi>Venice,</hi> but as ſoone as he was arriued in <hi>Italy,</hi> it was publiſhed that he was for <hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Thurin</hi> the <hi>Popes Nuntio</hi> did what he could with the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> to hinder that he ſhould not receiue the Viſite of the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique.</hi> But the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> conſidering how much it imported to his Negotiation, receiued the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> with all demonſtration of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, not regarding the inſtances of the <hi>Nuntio,</hi> The comming of this
<hi>Cardinall</hi> was acceptable to the <hi>Pope,</hi> howſoeuer at the firſt ſight it did not pleaſe him, that a <hi>Cardinall,</hi> one of the principall in the <hi>Court,</hi> ſhould goe into a City Interdicted, and to a <hi>Republique</hi> which he held for rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Neuertheleſſe, the deſire he had to finiſh theſe Controuerſies, ſeeing <hi>Don Francis de Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro</hi> had done nothing, made him to wiſh that this
<hi>Cardinal</hi> would adioyne his endeuours. The <hi>Cardinall</hi> ſtayed for ſome time at <hi>Papozze</hi> a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage within the <hi>Dukedome</hi> of
<hi>Ferrara,</hi> confining vpon the <hi>Venetian</hi> Dominions: expecting the iſſue of <hi>Don Francis</hi> his Negotiation, together with the Anſwer of the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Maſter,</hi> and the <hi>Popes</hi> Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:17285:191"/> In this <hi>interim</hi> the
<hi>Ieſuites</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> and in <hi>Spaine,</hi> but much more in
<hi>Spaine,</hi> did their vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeuours to be compriſed in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; diſplaying their great merits towards the Crowne of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> and the ſmall reputation which his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> ſhould haue if the Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were made, and themſelues excluded, who had defended more than all others his Intereſts; and that the <hi>Catholique King</hi> would receiue a great diminution in his Authority, as being not able for his ſeebleneſſe to range the <hi>Venetians</hi> vnder reaſon. And they brought the example of <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> concerning an accord made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Wolues and the Sheepe, vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that the Dogges ſhould bee baniſhed, Wherein they compared al the reſt of the World to Sheepe, which had need of their keeping. And they publiſhed ſome Bookes with theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and which is more employed herein the
<hi>Confeſſor</hi> of the <hi>Queene,</hi> a Father of their
<hi>Society,</hi> who openly ſaid not only to the <hi>King,</hi> but to all the <hi>Court,</hi> that they could not with good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence make this accord without comprehending the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> and couenanting their reſtitution.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Cardinall de Ioyeuſe</hi> hauing at length receiued very ample inſtructions from his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
               <pb n="356" facs="tcp:17285:192"/> and new commandements from the <hi>King,</hi> (by an expreſſe <hi>Currier,)</hi> came to <hi>Venice</hi> about the fifteenth of <hi>February,</hi> where he preſented his <hi>Letters</hi> of credit from the <hi>Moſt Chriſtian King,</hi> in a publique Audience, and paſſed ſome words of complement, both in the <hi>Kings</hi> Name, and in his owne: And the morrow he was viſited by the <hi>Duke,</hi> his diſcourſes being ſuch as the day before. Hee was receiued not onely with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of all ſorts of Honour, but further was lodged and defrayed ſumptuouſly on the publique charge; which he would not ſuffer, but prayed the <hi>Signiory</hi> that he might liue at his owne expence, and it was permitted as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cardinall</hi> immediately gaue beginning vnto the Treaty; ſaying, that he had Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the <hi>King</hi> to procure the weale and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of the <hi>Republique,</hi> and becauſe he knew how profitable Peace was, both to them and to all <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> he had interpoſed himſelfe in this Agreement. Therefore hee deſired there might be found ſome temperament to ſatisfie the <hi>Pope,</hi> and to maintaine the Reputation of the <hi>Republique.</hi> That the <hi>Pope</hi> expected and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed (beſides that which had beene treated,)
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:17285:192"/> that the <hi>Republique</hi> ſhould ſend an <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> to require his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> to take away and reuoke his <hi>Cenſures;</hi> that all the <hi>Religious,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> ſhould be reſtored; and that the
<hi>King</hi> might giue his word to the <hi>Pope,</hi> that the Lawes ſhould not be executed during the Treaty. Vpon which point, the <hi>Cardinall</hi> inſiſting more than vpon any other, prayed them to yeeld that the
<hi>King</hi> might paſſe his word, &amp; that to this effect they would proceed ſpeedily and with ſecrecy.</p>
            <p>If ſeemed very ſtrange to the <hi>Senate</hi> that the
<hi>Pope</hi> made ſo many circuits, notwithſtanding they would not retract what they had once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed: On the contrary, they confirmed to the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> all that for which they had formerly giuen their word to
<hi>Freſne;</hi> to wit, that the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi> being once taken away, they would ſend an <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> to reſide at <hi>Rome,</hi> who ſhould there Treat the point touching the <hi>Religious</hi> gone forth of the <hi>State:</hi> That for the Lawes they would proceed in the vſe of them with ſuch moderation and piety, as hath beene euer pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the
<hi>Republique,</hi> and to their Anceſtors: That this ought ſufficiently to ſatisfie the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>King.</hi> Hereupon the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> teſtified, that the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Maſter</hi> was greatly ſatisfied
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:17285:193"/> with all that which the <hi>Republique</hi> had yeelded to the <hi>Pope</hi> in Fauour of Him: But his
<hi>Holineſſe</hi> being not willing to reſt herewith with content, his
<hi>Maieſtie</hi> for the Seruice of the <hi>Republique,</hi> for the quiet of <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> and for the deſire of Peace, prayed them to finde ſome temper, by meanes whereof, without hurting the Liberty and Dignity of the <hi>Republique,</hi> the Buſineſſe might be finiſhed. Neuertheleſſe he adioyned, ſince it ſeemed not good to his
<hi>Serenitie</hi> to paſſe any farther, that he would thinke thereon more maturely, and weighing that which had beene read and ſaid, that then hee would returne to Treat with more ſolliditie.</p>
            <p>Another day the <hi>Cardinall</hi> returned with an inſtance more vehement and more particular, demanding that the <hi>King</hi> might giue his word vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> that the Lawes ſhould not be Practiſed during the Treaty; which he endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to perſwade, ſaying, That the
<hi>King</hi> deſirous of the good of <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> and a Friend of the <hi>Republique,</hi> conſidering the perill which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vpon the diſcord of two <hi>Princes</hi> ſo neere, and ioyned in their Intereſts, as alſo the damages of Warre; after all well weighed, was of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there might be found ſome meanes to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:17285:193"/> theſe Differences with Reputation, preſeruing entire the Libertie of the <hi>Republique,</hi> conſidering it was no ſeaſon to take Armes. And to this end hee had charge to ſpeake to them, as men ought to Friends, clearely and freely, but with this Caution, not to doe preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice vnto their Friend. Wherefore he ſaid free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his
<hi>Serenity,</hi> that as the <hi>King</hi> approued that no Decree might be made whereby might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare the Suſpenſion of the Lawes, or that they had not bin executed, or any other which might bring damage to the publique Dignity or Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not any act which might remaine in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or by memory paſſe to Poſterity: So againe he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered that the <hi>Pope</hi> hauing publiſhed the <hi>Cenſures</hi> in the ſight of the World, it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that he ſhould haue ſome apparent reaſon to reuoke them. But whereas the <hi>Republique</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted ſo much the Suſpenſion of the Lawes, which the <hi>Pope</hi> required, his <hi>Maieſty</hi> therefore had interpoſed: and ſeeing the parties ſo diſtant, he was reſolued to giue teſtimony vnto the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi> of his affection, (firmely to maintaine their Reaſons of not comming to any Decree) and yet withall to giue ſome ſatisfaction vnto the <hi>Pope:</hi> Taking this charge vpon himſelfe, to
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:17285:194"/> giue the <hi>Pope</hi> his word according to his deſire but that the <hi>Republique</hi> ſhould not make there upon any Decree; with condition on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> that his word ſhould not be otherwiſe vnderſtood to be giuen, but vpon aſſurance that at the ſame time he ſhould take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the
<hi>Cenſures;</hi> and on the part of the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> that (the
<hi>King</hi> taking this obligation vpon himſelfe) they ſhould render him this reſpect, not to doe any thing in execution of the Lawes, which might giue diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment vnto the <hi>Pope.</hi> By meanes of which temperament it ſeemed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>King</hi> that the Affaire might be accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated with ſatisfaction to both ſides, without wronging the Liberty of the
<hi>Republique,</hi> and to their contentment.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cardinall</hi> adioyned a long conſideration, how in the beginning, in the progreſſe, and at the end of theſe Differences, all things had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſo much Reputation on the ſide of the
<hi>Republique,</hi> as they could not expect more. But the Time now counſelled them to conſider the dangers &amp; damages which might enſue for the time to come, ſuch as all the World abhorred, as contrarily the Agreement was vniuerſally deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Wherefore it was not fit to reiect a motion
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:17285:194"/> by meanes whereof all queſtions might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided with credit. When the <hi>Cardinall</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
<hi>Mounſieur de Freſne</hi> Propoſed, that the <hi>King</hi> ſeeing it was neceſſary to giue the <hi>Pope</hi> this word, who by all meanes deſired this ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſince it was meet to giue it Him, who had (at the inſtance of the <hi>King)</hi> condeſcended to this Treaty, this point ought not to be put in difficulty, but to be holden as reſolued: That it was not to the purpoſe to examine whether it were reaſonable, in as much as it was not propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed out of reaſon, but only to giue ſome pretext vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> that he might be able to retire himſelfe with ſome Reputation. Wherefore the <hi>Pope</hi> being conſtant to haue this word, and the <hi>Senate</hi> (rightly) iudging it vniuſt to make any Decree, it was needfull to finde ſome meanes to giue it. For (to ſpeake freely) whoſoeuer ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the Decree of the <hi>Senate</hi> literally, which had bin read vnto them, where it was ſaid, <hi>That in the vſe of the Lawes they would not depart from their accuſtomed piety,</hi> &amp;c. They ſhould ſee plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the <hi>Republique</hi> reſerued ſtill to themſelues Power to vſe them: and the <hi>Pope</hi> did not intend that they ſhould be vſed, but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhould be, as it were, bound by the word
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:17285:195"/> which the <hi>King</hi> ſhould giue him touching them: therefore that it was neceſſary to declare themſelues. If the <hi>Senate</hi> did meane that theſe words ſhould ſuffice to giue aſſurance that the Lawes ſhould not be executed, and if they did not vſe theſe words <hi>[in the uſe]</hi> to any other end but that it might not appeare in writing that they began againe to execute them, then it was fit at leaſt to make this appeare by ſome ſigne, ſo as the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> might ſerue himſelfe of this Expoſition: That it would ſuffice him if either by ſpeech or action they gaue him a ſigne here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſuch as he might comprehend. Becauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>King</hi> would giue his word in writing, it behoued that he ſhould be aſſured that the
<hi>Republique</hi> would not diſauow it, and that he might not haue occaſion to repent himſelfe to haue giuen it, and ſo to remaine diſguſted; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very much that the <hi>King</hi> ſhould make the
<hi>Pope</hi> contented with this falſe money, this word being to ſerue only as a pure ceremony. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the <hi>King</hi> ſaid, that the Lawes being prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiue, and conſiſting in <hi>nonfaciendo,</hi> they had their Execution whilſt things reſted in ſuſpence; hauing taken vpon him to worke in ſuch ſort, that on the part of the <hi>Pope</hi> and the
<hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiques,</hi>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:17285:195"/> nothing ſhould be done to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And the <hi>King</hi> might be well able to giue this word without ſaying any more; as being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that if the <hi>Eccleſiaſtiques</hi> on their part ſhould not make any enterpriſe in this regard, the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Republique</hi> ſhould not be occaſioned to come to the execution of their Lawes; ſo that as on the one ſide they ſhould not be executed, ſo on the other they ſhould not be violated. And here the
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> repeated, that although the <hi>King</hi> might giue this word without the conſent of the <hi>Republique,</hi> in as much as it ſufficed him to be aſſured by the <hi>Pope,</hi> that no
<hi>Eccleſiaſtique</hi> ſhould giue occaſion to the execution of theſe Lawes againſt his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> nor to the violation againſt the <hi>Republique,</hi> notwithſtanding it was neceſſary that the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> ſhould giue him ſome anſwer. <hi>Freſne</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned moreouer, that vnderſtanding how the <hi>Spaniards</hi> preſſed to haue the ſame word, but in a more open and explicite faſhion, the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> had purpoſely thus tempered his Propoſition; beleeuing it not to be conuenient for the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> that they ſhould reſt obliged by the word of two <hi>Kings,</hi> ſpecially ſince the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> would not content themſelues with that mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:17285:196"/> ſweetneſſe with which his <hi>King</hi> would be ſatisfied. And he made inſtance that at leaſt they would reſolue him by ſome intimation, becauſe he ſaw there remained nothing elſe. For tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the reeſtabliſhment of the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued there would be no difficulty, ſince the <hi>K.</hi> did not doubt of it; being an ordinary thing in Agreements, that they who haue fomented the one and the other party returne again into their places: ſeeing eſpecially that the <hi>Pope</hi> could not conſent without wronging his Reputation, that they who went out only to obey him, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine excluded. And he did not thinke that this difficulty could be ſurmounted, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that they had to doe with a <hi>Pope</hi> ſtiffe and heady, and there being no particular cauſe why they ſhould deny him this ſatisfaction. That he was willing to ſpeake of this point which had beene paſſed in ſilence by the <hi>Card</hi> through modeſty, to the end that herein might be no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment when they came to the Concluſion of the Affaire.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Senate</hi> anſwered the <hi>Cardinall</hi> that the baniſhment of the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> had beene decreed for cauſes ſo important, and with ſuch formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that by the Lawes of the
<hi>Republique,</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:17285:196"/> could not bee reuoked. And that when vpon Agreements the adherents of the one part and the other come to be reeſtabliſhed, thoſe are not wont to be comprehended, who are otherwiſe guiltie of ſuch offences, as that they ſhould be baniſhed without the occaſions in queſtion. And for that which concernes the Reputation of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> touching the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of thoſe who were gone out vpon his occaſion, the returne of them would be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who had not committed other particular faults. For the reſt, the <hi>Senate</hi> ſaid, that they could not but commend the good will of the <hi>King,</hi> and of the
<hi>Cardinall,</hi> and thanke them both for their good aduice: But for the matter of giuing any word touching the execution of the Lawes, the
<hi>Senate</hi> could ſay nothing elſe, than that which they had ſo often repeated, that in the vſe of them they would neuer depart from their ancient Piety and Religion, which might ſuffice the <hi>King</hi> and the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> in that point, adding that they would communicate the ſame to <hi>Don Francis de Caſtro.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Cardinall</hi> had a deſire to haue obtained more, and to haue receiued an anſwer more conformable to his propoſition: neuertheleſſe
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:17285:197"/> being come with reſolution from the
<hi>Pope</hi> to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modate vpon any termes the Contention, yet with the moſt aduantage that he might, he ſaid, That although he wiſhed to haue had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer more conformable to his demand, and though he had no great reaſon to thanke them for that hee had receiued; notwithſtanding ſince that the <hi>King</hi> was willing to haue all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the contentment of the
<hi>Republique,</hi> hee would content himſelfe, requeſting them not to publiſh to any whomſoeuer this their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but to conceale it ſecret, foraſmuch as the Affaire might be diſturbed by ſome Spirit enuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the common good, and ſecrecy alone might much conduce to a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion. The <hi>Duke</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſaid, that of neceſſitie they muſt needs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the purſuits of <hi>Don Francis,</hi> who hauing made the like and equiualent propoſitions, muſt alſo receiue the like anſwer, eſpecially ſeeing he teſtified a good intention. That neuertheleſſe they would doe it with ſuch reſeruedneſſe and caution that the ſecret ſhould not be too much publiſhed: That this ought not to moue the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> becauſe it was a thing well knowne to all, that all had beene to gratifie him, and all that followed vpon this
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:17285:197"/> Treaty muſt be aſcribed to him. The
<hi>Cardinall</hi> confeſſed that <hi>Don Francis de Caſtro</hi> had a good intention, affirming that he would euery where giue him this teſtimonie: but he beleeued not, that he had in this Affaire the like power from the
<hi>Catholique King,</hi> as had the Miniſters of <hi>France</hi> from their
<hi>King:</hi> becauſe the termes which they deſigned to vſe with the
<hi>Pope,</hi> came from the ſole inuention of his Maty, wherwith if others were acquainted he would willingly vnite with them: But knowing not whether others had the ſame inſtructions, he iudged ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy neceſſary, requeſting them to proceed with dexteritie, and not to vtter all at once, but ſo to carry the matter as might beſt ſerue to make a concluſion of this Buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding theſe reaſons the <hi>Senate</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained firme in their purpoſe to communicate all to <hi>Don Francis de Caſtro,</hi> as well becauſe he had made the ſame propoſition, as becauſe at the arriuall of the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> he went to viſit him, and offered to vnite himſelfe with him, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the intentions of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> and of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique King,</hi> and of the
<hi>Republique,</hi> ſo far that he ſaid vnto the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> that he would fight vnder his Colours. To which the <hi>Cardinall</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:17285:198"/> anſwered, that he could ſay nothing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, becauſe he expected a certaine anſwer from the <hi>Republique; Don Francis</hi> much maruelled that the <hi>Cardinall</hi> made difficulty of this Vnion, and was many times inſtant with the <hi>Senate</hi> to declare vnto him what anſwer that was which the <hi>Card.</hi> expected. And although the
<hi>Senate</hi> had imparted all vnto him (whereof he was well aſſured,) yet he iu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dged aright, that the Vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was neuer the neerer: And therfore he made inſtance ſeparately, that for the honour of his <hi>King</hi> and of Himſelfe, they would accord him ſomething further, not preiudiciall. For although they had formerly done much, yet that ſufficed not: but when they ſhould accord a Suſpenſion of the Lawes for ſome Moneths, ſo as he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, all would bee accommodated, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided that they did it ſpeedily, to the end that the Armes now in readineſſe might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no ſcandall. But when this laſt anſwer giuen vnto the <hi>Cardinall</hi> was communicated to him, hee ſaid, it was not ſo cleare as hee deſired: But although the words were not ſo intelligible as he could wiſh, yet it ſeemed to him that he might thence inferre, that the <hi>King</hi> might giue his word for not executing the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:17285:198"/> Lawes during the Treaty, and that ſo the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood them. But becauſe he would walke ſafely and with ſincerity, he remembred them, that when he ſiguified vnto them how that the
<hi>Pope</hi> would take away the <hi>Cenſures</hi> and conclude the Affaire, ſo that he had the word of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique King,</hi> that during the Treaty the Lawes ſhould not be obſerued; this he ſaid preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the word to be cleare and without any vaile. And though he beleeued that they would haue it ſo taken, yet neuertheleſſe he wiſhed it had beene clearer. And howſoeuer he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with it, becauſe he preſuppoſed the <hi>Cardinal</hi> in like manner to be contented, yet he could not ingage his word in a thing vncertaine, wherewith he knew the <hi>Pope</hi> would not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied: but onely he would repreſent the eſtate of Affaires, and ſee what the <hi>Pope</hi> would ſay. That he imagined the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> to be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it, becauſe he had told him, he had brought an aduice from his <hi>King,</hi> vpon which he expected the anſwer of the <hi>Republique,</hi> and that he would not be diſtaſted if the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> could vpon good conditions finiſh the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. He added, that although this delay diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed him, which was cauſed by their obſcure
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:17285:199"/> anſwer, whereby the Affaire might be prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, repeating many times, although he deſired more cleareneſſe in their anſwer, neuertheleſſe he would ſo vnderſtand it, that in vertue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he might paſſe his word; in the end conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that he would expound their ſilence to be a confeſſion.</p>
            <p>To this laſt point the <hi>Duke</hi> anſwered, that the
<hi>Senate</hi> ſpake very clearely, and in ſuch ſort that any one might vnderſtand them without any need of expoſitions or coniectures; that they intended not in any faſhion to deſiſt from the vſe of their Lawes eſtabliſhed with iuſtice and lawfull authority; howſoeuer they promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to practiſe them with their accuſtomed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and moderation, and ſo as behoued the ancient piety and deuotion of the
<hi>Republique.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Treaties were thus in ſuch forwardnes, that there was, as it were, a firme hope of an Accord, if on the contrary the precipitation of
<hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> to take Armes, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of the
<hi>Griſons</hi> (which not onely conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued but increaſed,) had not forced men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> wiſhed Warre, and that they entertained the world with propoſitions of Peace, when in the meane while their facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:17285:199"/> Partiſans continued to moue euill humors, and procure ſeditions, not onely by falſe reports (which preuaile much among baſe people,) but further by gifts and preſents, which corrupt thoſe who cannot be deceiued. In <hi>Spaine</hi> they obſerued the danger of theſe running rumors; therefore at that ſame time when the <hi>King</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the <hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> to draw out 10000. Musketiers, he writ vnto him withall, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the danger of Warre by the diſſentions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Republique,</hi> to diuert it he had declared himſelfe for the <hi>Pope,</hi> that he might merit well of the
<hi>Holy See,</hi> and cauſe him to condeſcend and accept the conditions which he refuſed: That to this purpoſe he had ſent <hi>Don Francis de Caſtro</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> where fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding greater reſiſtance then he had thought, he had giuen him charge to vnite his offices with thoſe of other
<hi>Princes.</hi> But the difficulties ſtill growing, he had beene willing to try the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, which was to ſhew himſelfe intereſſed for the
<hi>Church,</hi> and by this meanes to take from the <hi>Republique</hi> their hopes grounded vpon the <hi>Popes</hi> feebleneſſe. But foraſmuch as this was ſiniſterly interpreted by ſome ill affeoted, he was reſolued to publiſh this his Deliberation (giuing
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:17285:200"/> notice thereof to his Miniſters,) to wit, that they ſhould not take decaſious, how fit ſoeuer, to ſo ment the Warre.</p>
            <p>Among the <hi>Griſons,</hi> the Mutiners were now to the number of
2000 amongſt whom a bruit was cunningly ſeattered, that the <hi>Repub.</hi> of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> had bought the paſſage for 80000 crowns, and therefore they would know by whoſe hands this money had paſſed. Vpon which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the <hi>Reſident</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> finding himſelfe not ſafe at <hi>Coira,</hi> purpoſed to retire himſelfe to <hi>Toſana.</hi> But the Muriners, without any reſpect, came 200. of them into his Houſe and ſtaied him, ſaying, That it was no time to be going, but to giue them account who they were that had receiued the money from the <hi>Signiory</hi> of
<hi>Venice,</hi> and paſſed to very inſolent ſpeeches; whereupon the
<hi>Reſident</hi> was forced to retire himſelfe. He made complaint of this affront to the <hi>Councell,</hi> requiring that they might be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed; but in the <hi>Councell</hi> there was neither power nor vertue, the principall of them and moſt couragious being abſent, ſome hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired themſelues becauſe of theſe ſtirres, and others being in the
<hi>Valtoline</hi> or in <hi>Ambaſſage</hi> Notwithſtanding thoſe of the <hi>Councell</hi> offered
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:17285:200"/> him a conuoy to conduct him to
<hi>Toſana,</hi> with which being on the way, he was encountred by a multitude of people, who conſtrained him to returne into his Houſe, where he was guarded as a priſoner, not ſuffered to write or receiue a Letter: Onely to ſweeten a little this barbarous vſage, they gaue him foure Gentlemen to beare him company. Afterward a rumor was raiſed that the
<hi>Lorraines</hi> were in the field, and ſaid that they would open the paſſage by force if it were not yeelded in amity; which renewed againe the mutiny, ſo as the multitude came with ſuch fury to the <hi>Reſidents</hi> houſe, that he could hardly be defended by his guard. The Partiſans of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> although they were bankrupt, yet ceaſed not to ſcatter money and put in Armes their Adherents; but with all this they could not hinder, but that the multitude at length gaue care to better counſell, and was perſwaded to expect the aſſembly of all the Companies, and in the meane while to free the <hi>Reſident,</hi> vpon promiſe that he ſhould arrend the Aſſembly. It was the ſeuenth day after he had beene forced that he was ſet at liberty; but by and by after followed a new encounter. For the ſouldiers that had beene leuied for the ſeruice of the
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi>
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:17285:201"/> cited their Captaines, and commanded them to giue their pay; which forced the <hi>Reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> to giue the Captaines
2000. Crownes for this effect, and by that meanes the Sedition was pacified, and in the <hi>interim</hi> the Troupes or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies were aſſembled.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Spaine,</hi> becauſe the Negotiation of <hi>Don Francis de Caſtro</hi> did not ſucceed as they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ſince the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Sauoy</hi> made conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall inſtances to the
<hi>King,</hi> that he would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue his iourney to <hi>Venice,</hi> they reſolued at length to giue way vnto him, although they held him rather a Souldier then a fit inſtrument of Peace, thinking it alſo dangerous to deny him ſuch a demand. Notwithſtanding they gaue him an ambiguous anſwer, as beleeuing not that he would Treat conformably to the intention of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> but that as a ſouldier hee thought to be employed in the Warre by one of the Parties, rather then to agree them. And becauſe they began to ſuſpect that the <hi>Pope</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying vpon the ſuccours of
<hi>Spaine</hi> would refuſe too ſtifly to admit a Concord, the
<hi>Catholique King</hi> aduertiſed the <hi>Nuntio</hi> by his Miniſters, that, to the end they might be more ready in <hi>Italy,</hi> he had giuen order vnto all the Captaines
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:17285:201"/> (who were retired to repoſe themſelues in their houſes,) that they ſhould preſent themſelues with all the power they could vpon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>France,</hi> and had alſo written vnto the <hi>Viceroys</hi> of <hi>Barçelona</hi> and of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> that they ſhould put all the Forces they could poſſibly in the Forts vpon the Frontiers. Neuertheleſſe they adioyned, that it would well become the
<hi>Pope,</hi> for diuerſion of theſe broyles and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, to ſupport ſome ſmall faults in his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, though to him they ſeemed great. And a few daies after on another occaſion they told the <hi>Nuntio,</hi> that the
<hi>King</hi> ſhould doe more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice vnto the <hi>Apoſtolique See</hi> by repreſſing the Heretiques in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> then by fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the troubles of <hi>Italy,</hi> and that ſo much the more as the
<hi>Pope</hi> ſhould bee aſſiſted by <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſo much the more ſtraitly would the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> league themſelues with the enemies of the <hi>Catholique</hi> faith: wherefore it was good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, that the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould neglect his owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate intereſts for the vniuerſall good of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome.</hi> In concluſion, to ſpeake more cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they ſaid, that it did not beſeeme the Father of all
<hi>Chriſtendome</hi> to ground a Warre ſo cruell and pernicious to
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> people, vpon a <hi>King</hi>
               <pb n="376" facs="tcp:17285:202"/> ſo pious, and that his
<hi>Holineſſe</hi> would abaſe the <hi>Apoſtolique</hi> Dignitie, if he ſuſtained by humane meanes the Authority which <hi>God</hi> had giuen him. They ſaid further, that it was meet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the <hi>King</hi> with ſome thing for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration which he had made, ſince thereby he had drawne vpon himſelfe ſo many enemies: aiming herein either at the
<hi>Tenths</hi> of the <hi>Realme</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> or at the remitting of the <hi>Fief.</hi> It is certaine that this newes extremely troubled the
<hi>Pope,</hi> ſeeing them when there was no need to make ſo liberall offers, and in time of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thus to retire.</p>
            <p>But in <hi>Lorraine,</hi> the <hi>Count de Vaudemont</hi> fell ſicke. Some attributed the cauſe thereof to a wound which he had receiued in his head, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a <hi>Hart</hi> a yeare before, whereby he loſt a good quantity of bloud; and others to the vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which he receiued by the importunities of ſo many in different places. In the meane while, Aduices came from <hi>Italy,</hi> that the Diſſentions were likely to be accommodated. <hi>Montagu</hi> the <hi>Reſident</hi> at <hi>Venice</hi> for the great <hi>Duke,</hi> writ vnto the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> that the <hi>Cardinal de Ioyeuſe</hi> and <hi>Freſne</hi> had aſſured him that the Accord would certainly follow their Negotiation; but
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:17285:202"/> that they kept it ſecret, becauſe being knowne, if it were not agreeable to all, it might be interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The
<hi>Duke</hi> viſited the <hi>Count de Vaudemont,</hi> and comforted him with this aduice, promiſing him that the <hi>Secretary Padauin</hi> would returne contented. And calling Him to ſpeak with him vpon this aduice, firſt he excuſed himſelfe for deferring to Treat with him, becauſe he was hindered by the <hi>Diet:</hi> then told him that from <hi>Rome</hi> and from
<hi>France</hi> he had certaine aduice that the Peace was vpon concluding. That the Preparations at <hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> were ſlackened, and ſo the occaſion of the Leuie ceaſed. And howſoeuer hee had a charge to ſollicite it, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe things now being vpon termes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, he ought to ſurceaſe vntill he had further co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. That his inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion was very good, and that he would not deferre to prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but onely to ſpare them charges: praying him to repreſent vnto the
<hi>Republique</hi> this his good office and counſell which he gaue with ſincerity. The <hi>Secretary</hi> thanked him, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all wiſhed him to conſider that oftentimes ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of Peace were ſcattered, which in effect vaniſh into ſmoake; and that the <hi>Pope</hi> was then fartheſt off, when he ſeemed to be the neareſt;
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:17285:203"/> That the <hi>Republique</hi> hauing yeelded ſomething, in ſtead of being appeaſed he required yet more: That the
<hi>Pope</hi> hauing publiſhed in <hi>Conſiſtory</hi> his finall reſolution to the Warre, vanting himſelfe of the Aſſiſtance of
<hi>Princes,</hi> and naming a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> this had made the
<hi>Republique</hi> to Arme for the common repoſe: That the diligence which the <hi>Count</hi> had teſtified of his willingneſſe to ſerue them, had moued the <hi>Senate</hi> to ſend Him into <hi>Lorraine;</hi> That none knew better their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities than the <hi>Republique</hi> themſelues, &amp; that his <hi>Highneſſe</hi> ought to beleeue him, knowing well that the
<hi>Senate</hi> would not caſt themſelues vpon needleſſe expences. Wherefore it was not to the purpoſe to write vnto <hi>Venice</hi> that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie might be deferred, but rather to take ſuch order that he might write that their Souldiers were ready in the field. The <hi>Duke</hi> replied, that what he had ſaid of the Peace was vpon good ground, &amp; that he deſired this ſatisfaction that he would write according to his counſell, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince the indiſpoſition of the <hi>Count</hi> his Sonne might diſpenſe with his employment for ſome few dayes. Hereupon
<hi>Padauin</hi> conſented to write by an expreſſe <hi>Currier,</hi> ſaying, he hoped that the <hi>Count</hi> being recouered, whileſt they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:17285:203"/> an anſwer, would then take order to make the Leuy. To which the <hi>Duke</hi> anſwered nothing; and not withſtanding that many times, euen by interrogations, the <hi>Secretary</hi> was inſtant to haue an anſwer, whether the <hi>Count</hi> did ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly intend, as alſo the <hi>Duke</hi> his Father, to aſſiſt them, yet he could draw nothing from them. The <hi>Count</hi> ſent to ſee whether the
<hi>Secretary</hi> were ſatisfied by the <hi>Duke;</hi> to whom He anſwered, That he was to attend his recouery, that they made prayers for his health at <hi>Venice,</hi> whither he had written, aſſuring the
<hi>Republique</hi> of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice; which gaue the <hi>Count</hi> great comfort, and the <hi>Duke</hi> thanked <hi>Padauin,</hi> ſaying, That hee would acknowledge his Sonne owed his life vnto him.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Criuelli,</hi> Chamberlaine to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bauier,</hi> arriued at <hi>Nancy,</hi> bringing with him a
<hi>Breue</hi> from the <hi>Pope,</hi> by which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the inſtances made vnto the <hi>Count,</hi> to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelfe from the Seruice of the
<hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</hi> He had Audience of all ſeuerally with contentment. The
<hi>Count</hi> would not be ſeene by him, excuſing himſelfe by reaſon of his indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; but ſome dayes after being much impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned, he receiued him with condition, that he
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:17285:204"/> ſhould ſpeake but little, and be content with a ſhort anſwer, without replying. He had then Audience, where he endeuoured to moue the <hi>Count</hi> by Reaſons of <hi>Religion</hi> and of
<hi>State;</hi> To which the <hi>Count</hi> anſwered, that he had a care of his Honour, which was in ſuch ſort ioyned with <hi>Religion,</hi> that they could not be ſeparated. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauin</hi> met this <hi>Criuelli</hi> at the
<hi>Church,</hi> who vſed to him courteous words, ſaying, That the
<hi>Duke</hi> his <hi>Maſter</hi> deſired Peace, and that for this effect he had appointed publique Prayers, and that he proiected to goe in Pilgrimage, and that he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Peace would follow, conſidering that the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> really deſired it, both for the affaires of

<hi>Padauin</hi> complained vnto the <hi>Count</hi> in the Name of the

Vpon this ground he was reſolued, ſince he could not ſatisfie them with words, to abide all euill accidents that could happen, rather than giue way to this Leuie.
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:17285:206"/> Wherefore, when <hi>Padauin</hi> came to the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which the <hi>Duke</hi> gaue him in preſence of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bar</hi> his Sonne, where He declared, that although at <hi>Venice</hi> they greatly maruelled why the Souldiers were no ſooner in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet neuertheleſſe they were perſwaded that this default would be recompenſed with a greater diligence: The <hi>Duke</hi> anſwered, that he accounted the Peace to be in a manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and therefore there needed no more words; That the <hi>Republique</hi> hauing their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire accommodated, the <hi>Cenſures</hi> would fall on his <hi>Houſe:</hi> That for this cauſe they ought not to bring moleſtation vpon others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any fruit; ſeeing that the more he deſired to gratifie the <hi>Republique</hi> vpon all occurrences, ſo much the more ſory was hee that he could not permit his Children to ſerue againſt the <hi>Church;</hi> That on other occaſions he and his Children would be alwaies ready to employ themſelues with all their forces for the ſeruice of the <hi>Republique. Padauin</hi> apprehending the Negatiue ſo clearely, iudged it neceſſarie to ſpeake plainly, and ſaid, That the reports of Peace were without ground; that if they had beene true, he ſhould not haue had ſo many
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:17285:206"/> Commandments ſo often reiterated to ſollicite them, and although the Peace might follow vpon the Treaty, yet the
<hi>Count</hi> denying the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice which he owed, might render it difficult, becauſe the <hi>Pope</hi> hereby might be more hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: That the
<hi>Republique</hi> had not preſſed this Leuie ſo much, if they had not eſteemed it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie: That whoſoeuer puts himſelfe in the ſeruice of a <hi>Prince,</hi> ought to obey, not taking vpon him to iudge whether that which hee commandeth be neceſſary and conuenient, or not: That the feare of <hi>Cenſures</hi> was but a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, becauſe they knew certainly that the <hi>Pope</hi> would acknowledge his error, and keepe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from the like hereafter: That if Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication were valide in all caſes, <hi>Princes</hi> were vndone: That it was not meet to preſuppoſe infallibility in <hi>Popes,</hi> ſince <hi>God</hi> often permits wicked Ones for the chaſtiſement of the world: That the obligation of the <hi>Count</hi> by the conſent of the <hi>Duke</hi> his Father had beene contracted in time of Contentions; wherefore if he had no feare to promiſe it, he ought not to feare the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it. And he adioyned, that the <hi>Duke</hi> hauing demanded ſo much reſpite, as they might write and receiue anſwer, he knew not
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:17285:207"/> how they could come to a refuſall without breach of word. The <hi>Duke</hi> anſwered, that he held the Peace for aſſured, and euery houre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to heare of the Concluſion. After two houres audience, where paſſed many anſwers and replies on the one part and the other, the <hi>Duke</hi> continuing ſtill to ſay, that he expected the Concluſion, <hi>Padauin</hi> told him, that if they reſolued to ſay nothing elſe they ſhould declare themſelues, that he might immediately depart to prouide elſe where for the ſeruice of his <hi>Prince,</hi> ſince he could obtaine nothing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Them that were obliged. Vpon this the
<hi>Duke</hi> praied him to wait three or foure daies. The next morning
<hi>Padauin</hi> had audience of the <hi>Count,</hi> who at the firſt fight told him, that he deſired death rather then to be in this eſtate, which hee neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued would haue hapned: That hee could not diſſemble his griefe, for that he ſaw on the one ſide his owne engagement, and on the other the will of his Father, whom he durſt not contradict: That the <hi>Breues</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> &amp; the purſuits of many, eſpecially of the
<hi>Ieſuites,</hi> had put ſcruples into the <hi>Dukes</hi> mind, w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> he could not aboliſh, being aged &amp; ſubject torecciue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of terror: That he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe of the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi>
               <pb n="387" facs="tcp:17285:207"/> had iuſt cauſe to complaine of him for the money which he had receiued, ſeeing he failed them in time of need; but he proteſted that it was not his fault, and praied <hi>Padauin</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale with him, and ſpake with ſuch affection that teares fell from him.
<hi>Padauin,</hi> comforted him and ſaid, That in aduerſitie it was needfull to vſe prudence, and that he muſt complaine of the <hi>Pope</hi> who ſold away his reputation by meanes of his Father. Hee repeated vnto him the ſame things which he had ſaid to the <hi>Duke,</hi> with greater vehomence and confidence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting him to make a new tryall with his, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to take away all impediment, to the ſend that ſuch an action, which would blemiſh his honour, might not come to the knowledge of men. Vpon theſe words the <hi>Count</hi> promiſed to vſe all his power with the
<hi>Duke</hi> his Father, but withall remembred him that his Father by I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his yeares was feeble in body and mind, and oppreſſed with the ſuggeſtions of diuers. <hi>Padauin</hi> ſaw well that all this was nought but artifices; wherefore hauing waited the foure daies, he demanded Audience to take his leaue, which they prolonged, to ſerue themſelues of time. But in the end being conſtrained to dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courer
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:17285:208"/> themſelues, the <hi>Count</hi> propoſed this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That a Leuie ſhould be made vpon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that the men ſhould not ſerue againſt the <hi>Pope,</hi> and this onely to take away the ſcruple of the <hi>Duke</hi> his Father; obliging himſelfe that when once the ſouldiers were in <hi>Italy</hi> they ſhould obey the commandements of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi> without reſeruation. This
<hi>Padauin</hi> would not accept, that he might not violate the Capitulation, which was to ſerue <hi>Contra quoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque.</hi> So he reſolued to paſſe into <hi>Suitzerland,</hi> preſently after he was aduiſed where he might finde the <hi>Deputies</hi> of the <hi>Cantons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> in the meane while during theſe Differences, neglected not any thing which might ſuſteine his Dignity. For hauing learned out of the writings of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa</hi> was a Law altogether conformable to that of <hi>Venice,</hi> which forbade
<hi>Eccleſiastiques</hi> to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, he made inſtance that it might be reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Which the <hi>Republique</hi> readily obeyed, to doe a thing gratefull to his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> and to ſhew that the reuocation of their <hi>Edicts</hi> made the yeare before, as we haue formerly ſaid, had proceeded from a free diſpoſition, beleeuing alſo hereby to render the cauſe of the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:17285:208"/> Republique</hi> more odious. And vpon the like inſtance of the <hi>Pope,</hi> they gaue aduice of this reuocation in
<hi>Spaine</hi> by their <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> which was eſteemed in that
<hi>Court</hi> for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme affectation, whereby it appeared mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly that herein they would giue example not onely to <hi>Venice,</hi> but to
<hi>Portugall</hi> alſo, to <hi>Arragon,</hi> and to the <hi>King</hi> himſelfe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Sauoy</hi> ſignified vnto the
<hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique King</hi> by <hi>Iames Antony de la Tour</hi> his
<hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador</hi> Extraordinary arriued a little before in
<hi>Spaine,</hi> to giue aduice of a Mariage concluded betweene his Daughter and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> that he had accepted the Inſtructions of the <hi>Emperour</hi> to be Mediator of the Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Republique</hi> of <hi>Venice.</hi> To which the <hi>King</hi> anſwered in generall terms; but the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Lerma</hi> commended him for that he obeyed the <hi>Emperour,</hi> that the
<hi>King</hi> had ſo great a deſire of the Agreement, that he praied
<hi>God</hi> to grant him good ſucceſſe, that ſo good an effect might be produced by his meanes. The <hi>Duke</hi> without expecting any further, publiſhed his voyage, and gaue order to his <hi>Court,</hi> to make ready. Whereupon at <hi>Venice</hi> the bruit of his comming euery day more and more increaſed,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:17285:209"/> and the <hi>Duke</hi> ſent to <hi>Venice, Iohn Baptiſta Soluro</hi> with Letters of credence of 27. of
<hi>February,</hi> to giue notice vnto the <hi>Senate,</hi> how the
<hi>Emperour</hi> had ſent to <hi>Turin</hi> the <hi>Marquis</hi> of
<hi>Caſtillon,</hi> to ſollicite him to paſſe to <hi>Venice</hi> for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating of theſe Differences: which being willing to vndertake, as well to obey the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi> as to ſerue the <hi>Republique,</hi> he was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to defer no longer, but immediatly to begin his iourney, hoping that the <hi>Republique</hi> would well accept his comming and his interpoſing. That he had ſent his <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> to this end, to certifie the <hi>Republique</hi> of his good will and of the diligence which he would vſe. Audience was giuen to this <hi>Ambaſſadar</hi> on the 11. of
<hi>March</hi> with a courteous anſwer, that the <hi>Senate</hi> tooke in good part the comming of his <hi>Highneſſe.</hi> For this cauſe the
<hi>Cardinall de Ioyeuſe</hi> reſolued to ſend a Gentleman to
<hi>Rome,</hi> to aducrtiſe the <hi>Pope</hi> what had beene deliberated, and by the meanes of <hi>Alincourt</hi> to purſue the buſineſſe to a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But whileſt he was on diſpatching, hee changed his minde, and reſolued to goe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in perſon, and accordingly departed the day following, which was the 17. of the ſame Moneth of <hi>March.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="391" facs="tcp:17285:209"/> After the <hi>Cardinall</hi> was parted from
<hi>Venice,</hi> the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Caſtillon, Ambaſſador</hi> for the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> arriued there, and without any publique and ſolemne entry preſented himſelfe vnto the <hi>Duke.</hi> Where hauing put him in minde of the good offices which he had done him in <hi>Rome</hi> vpon the beginning of theſe troubles, to the end that the <hi>Pope</hi> might ſuſpend his <hi>Monitory,</hi> howſoeuer he did not preuaile as he deſired, for the euill diſpoſition of the Affaires: He ſaid fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he had alwaies done the ſame in the <hi>Court</hi> of the
<hi>Emperour,</hi> and that the <hi>Emperour</hi> vehemently deſiring to ſee an end of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies, had deſigned the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Sauoy</hi> to bring this good worke to effect, with whom he was willing to ioyne himſelfe for his great affection to the <hi>Republique,</hi> as well for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per intereſts as for thoſe of his Houſe. And that the
<hi>Duke</hi> being not able ſo ſuddenly to take his iourney, by reaſon of the great <hi>Court</hi> which did accompany him, the <hi>Emperour</hi> had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him who ſpake to haſten his voyage to giue beginning vnto the Treaty, leſt by too much delay the <hi>Griſons</hi> might come to Armes, which might put the Affaire out of all hope of Pacification. That now he was much comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:17285:210"/> vnderſtanding that the <hi>Senate</hi> in their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome had taken a pious reſolution, and found meanes that the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> was gone with ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction towards his
<hi>Holineſſe,</hi> and that matters had receiued ſome temperament. And he praied his <hi>Serenitie</hi> that he would make him partaker of all the particularities of the Affaire, offering to cooperate therein in the name of the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> to take away all difficulties which might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine: And vpon this preſented his Letters of credence from the <hi>Emperour</hi> and from the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Sauoy.</hi> The <hi>Senate</hi> gaue order to let him ſee the ſtate of things, and in particular commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to him the anſwer laſt giuen vnto the <hi>Cardinall.</hi> The <hi>Marquis</hi> was in great perplexity, and doubted they had not communicated all intirely, eſpecially how far the <hi>Republique</hi> had condeſcended: but being further aſſured that nothing had beene concealed from him, he made inſtance that he might carry vnto the <hi>Pope</hi> ſome little further ſatisfaction obtained in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the <hi>Emperour.</hi> But he preuailed nothing, the <hi>Senate</hi> telling him, that hauing yeelded ſo much as was poſſible without wronging their Liberty, they could yeeld no more; and that he might, if he pleaſed, propoſe vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> what
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:17285:210"/> had beene accorded to the Miniſters of
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> and Treat the Agreement vpon the ſame conditions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Card. de Ioyeuſe</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued at <hi>Venice,</hi> did hold the Affaire in a manner for accommodated; but ſeeing him afterwards depart without obtaining any more then what had beene yeelded to <hi>Freſne</hi> and to Them, they ſuſpected either that the Treaty was broken, or that the <hi>Pope</hi> dealt deceitfully with the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> hauing more ſecret intelligence with the
<hi>French.</hi> And <hi>Don Francis de Caſtro</hi> hauing writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the deliberation of the <hi>Senate</hi> communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, ſent ſpeedily the copie thereof to <hi>Rome</hi> to the <hi>Catholique Ambaſſador,</hi> who not onely ſhewed it to the <hi>Pope,</hi> but further publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed it thorow the <hi>Court,</hi> to the end that all might know, that the <hi>French</hi> could promiſe no more then they. But the <hi>Senate,</hi> to the end that the ſtate of things ſhould not be diuerſly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented according to the affections of them that Treated, gaue aduice of all to their Miniſters in all the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> ſending to euery one an extract of their laſt reſolution.</p>
            <p>Vpon the arriuall of the <hi>Cardinall</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> all the <hi>Court</hi> was moued, and euery one ſpake
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:17285:211"/> thereof according to his paſſion. Some deſired the Agreement, others abhorred it: by ſome it was holden for concluded, others beleeued it broken, and impoſſible. During ſome daies at the firſt, the <hi>Pope</hi> was in ſuch ſort diſtracted with diuers thoughts, that both He and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters greatly varied. Sometimes it ſeemed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that many points wanted in the Treaty, to come to a good end: otherwhiles they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that all might be compoſed. So that the
<hi>Pope</hi> being preſſed with ſo diuers inſtances and opinions, he confeſſed to Perſons worthy of faith, that he found himſelfe very irreſolute and in great perplexity. And he anſwered <hi>Alincourt</hi> (who knowing this irreſolution of the <hi>Pope,</hi> the third day after the arriuall of the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> went to him to complaine of a rumor diſperſed in <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Affaire could not be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated, or at leaſt concluded on ſuch condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as the <hi>King</hi> his
<hi>Maſter</hi> had obtained, and that this was to depriue his
<hi>Maieſtie</hi> of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of ſo great an enterpriſe and ſo much paines as he had taken,) that though hee were vexed with many conflicts, in ſuch ſort that for three daies ſpace he had beene in a perpetuall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hauing drawne from the <hi>Card. de Ioyeuſe</hi>
               <pb n="395" facs="tcp:17285:211"/> and the <hi>Ambaſſador Caſtillon</hi> nothing but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall words brought from the <hi>Venetians,</hi> he was not withſtanding reſolued to a Concord, proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that they ſhould make a new eſſay for the returne of the <hi>Ieſuites.</hi> It is very certaine, that many <hi>Cardinals</hi> who did not like the <hi>Popes</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation in comming ſo ſpeedily vnto <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> were then alſo diſpleaſed that he ſhould reuoke them without obtaining his Deſigne to make the <hi>Repub.</hi> ſubmit. And Some amongſt them did not ſticke to mutine and combine, with reſolution to contradict him in <hi>Confistory,</hi> wherein they were incouraged by ſome who aimed totally to hinder the Agreement, and by others to preuent at leaſt the <hi>Card. de Ioyeuſe</hi> that he ſhould not be the Author of it. That which was particularly Treated at <hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> and by the <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> was not at all communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Venice;</hi> ſo that they knew nothing of theſe Negotiations, ſaue onely ſo much as the
<hi>Ambaſſadors Caſtro</hi> &amp; <hi>Freſne</hi> ſpake, and that which hath beene written by the <hi>Card. du Perron,</hi> and by the
<hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Vrbin.</hi> For that which was ſaid by the two
<hi>Ambaſſadors,</hi> it ſhall be declared in due place. But the relations
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:17285:212"/> of the <hi>Cardinall</hi> and the
<hi>Archbiſhop</hi> imported, that it ſeemed vnto the <hi>Cardinall de Ioyeuſe</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Rome</hi> to negotiate and conclude the Agreement with the <hi>Pope,</hi> that there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther difficulty but that he could not promiſe the reſtoring of the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> which for many reaſons was arde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly deſired by his <hi>Holineſſe.</hi> That being aſſembled in counſell with the <hi>Ambaſſador Alin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> and the
<hi>French Cardinals,</hi> they had decreed to repreſent this point vnto the
<hi>Pope</hi> with ſome temperament. That accordingly after he had ſpoken of other points and giuen good content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a manner vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> he ſaid, That hee could not hope to obtaine by particular Treaty the reſtoring of the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> but he knew a courſe by meanes whereof without doubt their reeſtabliſhment might be obtained; which was, that his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> ſhould put in his hand a <hi>Breue</hi> with abſolute power to reuoke the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> which he would carry to
<hi>Venice,</hi> where hauing ſhewed his power he would tell them he had a charge to execute nothing but on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> might be readmitted: And by this meanes he hoped that when they ſaw at
<hi>Venice</hi> that nothing elſe remained but this onely point, to accord all queſtions, they
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:17285:212"/> would reſolute to giue him this contentment.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> wel rudged that his Honor would be much impaired, if he abandoned the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> who had beene chaſed (as he perſwaded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe) for their obedience to his <hi>Interdict;</hi> hauing alſo promiſed them that he would not encline to any Concord, but with condition that they ſhould be reſtored. Whereunto alſo was ioyned another point of his Reputation, That if for two Men of the <hi>Church</hi> impriſoned, he had made ſo much bruit in the World, it ſeemed to him that he ought much leſſe to endure the baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a whole <hi>Order.</hi> But the <hi>Cardinall du Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> perſwaded at length the <hi>Pope,</hi> telling him that if this were the only point to hinder the Treaty, the generall Cauſe which was in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie, would become the particular cauſe of the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> and not of the <hi>Apoſtolique See;</hi> adding, That firſt of all it was meet to reeſtabliſh his owne Authority at
<hi>Venice,</hi> which being once ſetled, it would be eaſie by that means to reſtore there the <hi>Ieſuites:</hi> wherefore, not to name them in this Treaty, was not abſolutely to exclude them, but only to deferre their reſtitution. To confirme his ſpeech, he called to minde the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of
<hi>Clement</hi> 8. who in the reconciliation
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:17285:213"/> of <hi>King Henry</hi> the fourth, notwithſtanding that he eſteemed highly that article of the returne of the
<hi>Ieſuites,</hi> yet ſeeing the difficulty of it, he was content to let it go, with hope to obtaine in due time what then ſeemed impoſſible; in which hope he was not deceiued, hauing afterwards eaſily obtained what he deſired. The <hi>Pope</hi> was content that the <hi>Cardinall de Ioyeuſe</hi> ſhould doe all he could poſſibly for the reſtitution of the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites,</hi> without inſiſting vpon that point, ſeeing he could not for that time paſſe further.</p>
            <p>But beſides this, three other difficulties croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Treaty of the <hi>Cardinall.</hi> The firſt, becauſe the <hi>Pope</hi> would haue
<hi>Mounſieur de Freſne,</hi> the <hi>French Ambaſſador</hi> at
<hi>Venice,</hi> demand by writing in the Name of the <hi>King,</hi> and of the
<hi>Republique,</hi> that the <hi>Cenſures</hi> might be taken away, ſo as
<hi>Don Inigo de Cardenas</hi> the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> had done: But the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>French King</hi> would haue this done by <hi>M. d' Alincourt</hi> his <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador</hi> at
<hi>Rome,</hi> wherewith at length the <hi>Pope</hi> was contented. As alſo that the ſaid <hi>Cardinall,</hi> and <hi>M. d' Alincourt,</hi> ſhould giue him their word in the Name of the <hi>King,</hi> that the Lawes ſhould remaine without execution, vntill the Accord might be effected. This the
<hi>Pope</hi> did not like
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:17285:213"/> on this faſhion, pretending that they ought to ſay, that it was with the conſent of the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> and vntill the Accord was effected. But the <hi>Cardinall de Ioyeuſe</hi> hauing not receiued here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon any word from the <hi>Republique,</hi> as hath bin ſaid, could not ſay that it was with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. The Copies of theſe Propoſitions, made by <hi>Cardenas, Alincourt</hi> and
<hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> are ſcattered ouer the World, but how true or falſe they are we cannot ſay, nothing of all this being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the
<hi>Republique,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Senate</hi> neuer gaue any word, excepting ſuch as hath beene formerly related.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it was the <hi>Popes</hi> will, that following the cuſtome of the <hi>Court,</hi> the <hi>Cenſures</hi> ſhould be taken away at <hi>Rome,</hi> beleeuing it an indignity (beſides the vnuſualneſſe of the matter) which would much diminiſh his Reputation, and that he ſhould too farre abaſe himſelfe, if he ſhould ſend a <hi>Cardinall</hi> to this effect. But the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>France</hi> very well conſidered that this was to diſſolue totally all that hitherto had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, becauſe without doubt at <hi>Rome</hi> many things would be propoſed by diuers Perſons to hinder and trauerſe the Affaire, and many new difficulties would be raiſed. And although all
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:17285:214"/> were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded, yet nothing could be executed at <hi>Rome,</hi> but in ſuch forme as might argue the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> of
<hi>Venice</hi> to haue faulted. Now at <hi>Venice</hi> it was certaine, they would endure nothing in the world which might imply that the
<hi>Cenſures</hi> had beene valide. Wherefore the <hi>French,</hi> holding this point to be moſt eſſential, did ſo well work the <hi>Pope,</hi> that he yeelded no act ſhould paſſe in <hi>Rome.</hi> They deſired further, that in the firſt <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory</hi> his
<hi>Holineſſe</hi> would communicate to the <hi>Cardinals</hi> what had beene deliberated; but he conſented not to doe it, only in a priuate Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he ſpake with ſome thereof, with reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to call foure or ſix a day into his Chamber, and take their opinions each one a part.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> preſuppoſed that the Priſoners ſhould be rendered without Proteſtation; but hauing vnderſtood that at
<hi>Venice</hi> they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to Proteſt, he was vpon the point to breake off all, if the <hi>Cardinall du Perron</hi> had not perſwaded him to the contrary, ſaying, That if on this occaſion he ought to breake, it would be more aduantageous to his Dignity that he ſhould breake at <hi>Venice,</hi> for then the cauſe of this breach would be wholly aſcribed to the
<hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> whereas if he brake in <hi>Rome,</hi> it would be
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:17285:214"/> attributed to his ſtiffeneſſe. By this meanes the <hi>Pope</hi> being ſetled, paſſed by this difficulty.</p>
            <p>In the firſt <hi>Conſiſtory</hi> which was made after theſe reſolutions, all the <hi>Cardinals</hi> were preſent, euen thoſe who for their indiſpoſition were not accuſtomed to come but very rarely, aſſuring themſelues that the <hi>Pope</hi> would communicate to them the reſolution which he had taken, and ſome amongſt them were prepared to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict. But the <hi>Pope</hi> after he had Treated ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conſiſtoriall matters, did not ſpeake hereof one word, only he heard them all in priuate Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience (for ſix dayes ſpace) ſpeaking to them of this Affaire, as of a thing already done. Some in their anſwers commended the action with many words, ſome with fewer; but ſome few oppoſed themſelues, and others to raiſe more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties repreſented new precautions. Some were of opinion that it was better to ſend the
<hi>Cardinall Borgheſe,</hi> and ſome others would haue the <hi>Cardinall Zapata</hi> ioyned with the <hi>Cardinall de Ioyeuſe.</hi> But the
<hi>Pope</hi> reſolued in himſelfe not to depart from his firſt deliberation, nor from that which had beene concluded with <hi>Ioyeuſe.</hi> Now remained only the forme of the <hi>Breue,</hi> full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame difficulties, the Queſtion being at once
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:17285:215"/> to ſaue both the Dignity of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> and of the <hi>Senate:</hi> a thing ſo much the more hard and knotty, becauſe it was without all example of former times. For anciently the
<hi>Popes</hi> taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their <hi>Cenſures</hi> at the ſupplication of them that had beene Cenſured, were able, by inſerting in their
<hi>Breues</hi> their Repentance and acts of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility which they had vſed, to make themſelues formidable no leſſe in their Pardons than in their Thunderings. But in this buſineſſe, the caſe was vtterly different, wherein they could not put one word to exalt the <hi>Popes</hi> actions, or in fauour of his <hi>Cenſures,</hi> but it would be ſufficient to breake the whole Treaty. Herein the <hi>Cardinall</hi> deuiſed a new and prudent temper, which was, not to expedite any <hi>Breue,</hi> but to Treat all at
<hi>Venice</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by word of mouth, that he might not bring to
<hi>Venice</hi> any ſhadow of ſuſpition, and that it might be free to the
<hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to publiſh that the <hi>Pope</hi> herein had done all with his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage. Wherefore following this aduice, they dreſſed only an Inſtruction to the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> to be ſubſcribed with the
<hi>Popes</hi> hand. His <hi>Holineſſe</hi> deſired alſo that ſome
<hi>Miniſters</hi> might aſſiſt the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> to ſee the Actions preſcribed in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> obſerued, touching the conſignation
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:17285:215"/> of the Priſoners, and the abolition of the
<hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures:</hi> and to receiue the Priſoners was named <hi>Claudio Montano,</hi> a Criminall Iudge at <hi>Ferrara.</hi> There remained yet a
<hi>Notary</hi> to receiue the Acts, and to this effect were named many
<hi>Notaries</hi> of the <hi>Chamber,</hi> but none of them pleaſed the
<hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall,</hi> who foreſaw what impediment the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the
<hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in ſuch Acts might bring to the execution of the Treaty. Wherefore he propoſed that <hi>Paul Catel,</hi> his Domeſticall
<hi>Chaplaine,</hi> might be created an <hi>Apoſtolique Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonotary,</hi> and employed as a <hi>Miniſter</hi> in theſe Actions which was accepted by the <hi>Pope,</hi> who was moſt deſirous to winde himſelfe by any meanes out of this Labyrinth, and accordingly he created <hi>Catel</hi> a
<hi>Protonotary,</hi> and ſubſcribed the Inſtruction for the
<hi>Cardinal,</hi> and diſpatched him, ſo as it was agreed. Of theſe Treaties they knew nothing at <hi>Venice,</hi> and as touching <hi>Paul Catel,</hi> when he came with the <hi>Cardinall</hi> he was neuer acknowledged for a <hi>Protonotary</hi> or <hi>Miniſter</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> nor did appeare in any other quality ſaue of the <hi>Caudatary</hi> (or Traine-bearer) of the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> neither was he euer ſeene to doe any other office. All this aboue-ſaid hath beene ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Relations written from <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="404" facs="tcp:17285:216"/> But in <hi>Venice</hi> the two
<hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſpake on another faſhion, the 29. of <hi>March.</hi> The firſt was <hi>Don Francis de Caſtro,</hi> who brought newes that things went well at <hi>Rome,</hi> the
<hi>Pope</hi> being contented with the principall point executed by the
<hi>Ambaſſador Aiton,</hi> who had giuen to his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> the word which he deſired in the Name of the <hi>Catholique King:</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning that if the <hi>Cardinall de Ioyeuſe</hi> had done the like, theſe Two had giuen the main ſtroke to the buſineſſe. He ſaid alſo that he liked well that the election of an <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> ſhould follow vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the reuocation of the <hi>Cenſures.</hi> And for the point of the
<hi>Ieſuits,</hi> that there would be no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, if they would ſpeake clearely in that of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing word for the Suſpenſion of the Lawes: but the
<hi>Pope</hi> was conſtant in his reſolution, ſaying, That in thoſe things which he deſired, men vſed guilded or diſguiſed words, but in thoſe which others willed, they ſpake clearely. To this the <hi>Duke</hi> replied preſently, that the <hi>Senate</hi> had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken clearely, yea moſt clearely, and that they did not intend to be obliged to any thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond or beſides that which they had expreſly ſaid.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of <hi>France</hi> after him repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:17285:216"/> that the <hi>Cardinall</hi> being arriued at
<hi>Rome,</hi> had found the <hi>Pope</hi> informed in all that which he purpoſed to propound, hauing knowne it firſt by others, and that hereupon his Holineſſe was much cooled. That the <hi>Pope</hi> at length diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him how that <hi>Don Francis de Caſtro</hi> had diſpatched foure <hi>Curriers,</hi> one after another, with aduiſe that the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> had not receiued any more ample word then himſelfe, &amp; that the ſame things which he had obtained of the <hi>Republique</hi> were to be ſeene in <hi>Rome</hi> in writing. That hee had nothing but generall words, which did not onely not conclude that which his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> pretended, but euen the contrary: whereby they might ſee that the voyage of the <hi>Cardinall</hi> had not any ſolid foundation. But that the
<hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall</hi> for all this, after he had ſuffered the <hi>Pope</hi> to ſay what he pleaſed, had giuen him ſo good ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, that he was appeaſed: and already all had been finiſhed, had it not been for that point of the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> which the <hi>Pope</hi> maruellouſly vrged. That his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> was contented with the word giuen him in the name of the <hi>King</hi> by the <hi>Cardinall</hi> and <hi>Alincourt,</hi> although he knew that they had it not from the <hi>Republique.</hi> But neuertheleſſe perſeuering in his deſire to haue
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:17285:217"/> the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> reeſtabliſhed, the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> knew not how to auoid it, but reſted in ſome feare leſt the reſolution hereof might cauſe delay in the buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>The day following <hi>Don Francis de Caſtro</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the
<hi>Duke</hi> to bring Newes, that by a <hi>Currier</hi> diſpatched vnto him with diligence fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Marquis d'Aiton,</hi> he was aduertiſed, that the impediment concerning the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> was taken away; for as much as the <hi>Pope,</hi> who till then had bin firme in his reſolution rather to breake, hauing heard the reaſons which he who ſpake had cauſed to be repreſented by a Gentleman ſent poſt to <hi>Rome,</hi> was in the end contented to let goe that point in gratification of the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>Spaine</hi> and of himſelfe. That the difficulties had been great, and he knew not whether other had helped to ſurmount them; but he prayed that in recompence they would accord him a Suſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Lawes for a time. Whereupon <hi>Don Francis</hi> diſcourſed with much skill and artifice, ſometime demanding it in conſideration of the <hi>Pope,</hi> ſometime to gratifie himſelfe, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in fauour of the <hi>King</hi> his
<hi>Maſter.</hi> Adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for concluſion, that at leaſt they ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord it till his departure. But the <hi>Duke</hi> remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:17285:217"/> conſtant in the anſwer giuen before, hee ſhewed a deſire that this his propoſition might be communicated to the
<hi>Senate.</hi> Wherefore vpon the morrow the <hi>Senate</hi> decreed to giue him anſwer, with thanks for that which he had done in the excluſion of the
<hi>Ieſuites,</hi> adioyning that for the reſt, hauing ſaid all that was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, they thought it not neceſſary to adde any thing further.</p>
            <p>But the 2. of <hi>Aprill</hi> following, the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of <hi>France</hi> brought the <hi>Newes</hi> of an entire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the Agreement, ſaying, that the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall</hi> himſelfe in Perſon would bring the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. Yet vnderſtanding that ſome others had diſpatched a
<hi>Currier,</hi> he was willing to doe the ſame. And that the <hi>Pope</hi> had put ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in him, that not harkning to the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of others, he was content to giue him power to take away the
<hi>Cenſures,</hi> which hee would accordingly execute vpon his arriuall at
<hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt care of the <hi>Cardinall</hi> after the Peace concluded, was to giue aduice thereof vnto the <hi>King</hi> who had ſent him: but after this, he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nothing more then to aduertiſe the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> as well for that he had inſtantly reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:17285:218"/> him to this purpoſe, as becauſe hee knew how much it imported the <hi>Pope</hi> that all Leuies of men beyond the
<hi>Mounts</hi> ſhould be ſtaied. The <hi>Duke</hi> therefore hauing receiued the aduice, ſent for the Secretary <hi>Padauin,</hi> telling him the
<hi>Newes</hi> of the Agreement, ſaying he had receiued it by a
<hi>Currier,</hi> with Letters from the <hi>Cardinall de Ioyeuſe</hi> and from the great <hi>Duke.</hi> Adioyning, that (without reſpect to the
<hi>Pope,)</hi> he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that the Leuie might be made, excuſing the negatiue which had paſſed, vpon reſpects of Conſcience and of Religion: as alſo for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of <hi>State,</hi> which cauſed his
<hi>Houſe</hi> to be ſtraitly vnited to the <hi>Church,</hi> beſides the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine hope which he alwaies had of this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, without which peraduenture hee had not beene moued. <hi>Padauin</hi> ſaid but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, to iuſtifie the actions of the <hi>Republique,</hi> and to condemne the
<hi>Eccleſiaſtiques,</hi> who aimed at a fourth <hi>Crowne</hi> by ſubmitting <hi>Princes</hi> vnto themſelues. The <hi>Duke</hi> ſaid, matters were now to be executed not deliberated, not knowing before that
<hi>Republiques</hi> could not better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for their gouernment then by good Lawes. The <hi>Count de Vaudemont</hi> teſtified herein very much contentment, and promiſed <hi>Padauin</hi> to
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:17285:218"/> begin the Leuie immediatly after
<hi>Eaſter,</hi> adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that it were good to cauſe the
<hi>Suiſſes</hi> to paſſe firſt, the better to facilitate the paſſage for the <hi>Lorraines. Padauin</hi> perceiued very well that the Deſigne of the <hi>Count</hi> in making the Leuie was to couer the loſſe of his reputation, and to obtaine of the <hi>Republique</hi> to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the charge of <hi>Generall</hi> of their Armies. Wherof He was further aſſured, when <hi>Monfieur de Vadiot</hi> told him, that the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> had offred the <hi>Count</hi> 15000. Crownes by the yeare to draw him to the feruice of their <hi>King,</hi> to which he ſaid the
<hi>Count</hi> would not giue care, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination which he had to ſerue the <hi>Republique.</hi> And that in the former paſſage of matters he had reſerued himſelfe, leſt his Father ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduantage him in his Teſtament: but it was not meet to thinke the like of his Brother, who had his Eſtate proper and ſeuerall, which might haue ſufficed for the Leuie which was deſired. <hi>Vadiot</hi> added, that although the Leuy had not beene made intirely before the concluſion of Peace, notwithſtanding that which was done already had giuen reputation to the <hi>Republique.</hi> He ſaid further in particular, that the <hi>Duke</hi> had neuer conſented to ratifie the Leuie, vnleſſe that
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:17285:219"/> clauſe were taken away, <hi>Contra quoſcunque.</hi> But <hi>Padauin</hi> being well certified of the concluſion of Peace by certaine aduice which he had from the <hi>Court</hi> of the <hi>Most Chriſtian King,</hi> deferred to deliuer the ſiluer appointed for the Leuy, vntill he were firſt aſſured of the paſſage of the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi> In this meane while, neither <hi>Padauin</hi> nor any of his <hi>Houſe</hi> were admitted to Confeſſion by any Confeſſor at <hi>Nancy,</hi> by the cunning ſleights of the
<hi>Ieſuites:</hi> but this Newes of the Accord being come, the
<hi>Rector</hi> of the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> ſent to him to excuſe himſelfe, offering to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him to Confeſſion if he would promiſe to doe nothing againſt the <hi>Pope.</hi> To whom he anſwered, that hauing hitherto learned nothing in their Schoole, he would not now begin in this Caſe.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe in <hi>Spaine</hi> the certaine Newes of the Agreement being arriued before <hi>Eaſter,</hi> the <hi>Popes Nuntio</hi> aduiſed the
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> that he ſhould abſtaine from the Communion at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> conſidering that ſhortly after he might be preſent with the <hi>Popes</hi> permiſſion. But the
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> would not receiue this counſell: on the contrary, he was confeſſed and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon holy <hi>Thurſday</hi> by
<hi>Francis Spinoſa</hi> a
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:17285:219"/> 
               <hi>Dominican, Prior</hi> of our <hi>Lady de Zocchia,</hi> hauing carried the Canopy ouer the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> and being admitted to all the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall.</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of that day, and euen to dinner with the <hi>Friars.</hi> And it is likely that that
<hi>Father</hi> did not this without the iudgement and conſent of other
<hi>Doctors,</hi> not onely <hi>Theologues</hi> which taught him this, but alſo of other profeſſions, without whom in the <hi>Court</hi> of ſo great a <hi>King,</hi> none dare vndertake ſuch enterpriſes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cardinall</hi> deſirous to bring his Treaty to an end, and hoping more eaſily to obtaine ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more for the <hi>Popes</hi> aduantage during thoſe <hi>Feſtiuall</hi> daies then at other times, made his iourney wth ſuch haſte, that in his paſſage by Sea from
<hi>Ancona</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> he expoſed his life to hazard. He arriued on Munday in the Holy Weeke, with great deſire to finiſh the Concord before the <hi>Feaſt.</hi> But the Affaire would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſo ſpeedy expedition, and the <hi>Senate</hi> (who knew well their owne innocence,) did not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme it meet to haſten matters, being aſſured they were as able and fit to participate in <hi>Diuine Seruices</hi> before the Concluſion as after it. The day following, which was the 10. of <hi>Aprill,</hi> the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> went to the <hi>Senate,</hi> and declared to
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:17285:220"/> them his charge, not making mention of any
<hi>Breue</hi> which he had from the <hi>Pope;</hi> and already men knew that he had nothing elſe but an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction ſubſcribed with the hand of his
<hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</hi> The <hi>Senate</hi> gaue credit to the power, which he ſaid he had from the <hi>Pope,</hi> (as being one of the prime
<hi>Cardinals</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and a Miniſter of the <hi>Moſt Chriſtian King,)</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhewing any writings from the
<hi>Pope</hi> at all. He certified firſt the <hi>Repub.</hi> of the
<hi>Popes</hi> good will, and his right intentions carried vnto the publique good of <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> excuſing the ſtiffneſſe which he had ſhewed in the Treaty, as proceeding from a zeale to ſuſtaine the
<hi>Papall</hi> dignity. But that, for all the good inclination of his
<hi>Holineſſe,</hi> the Affaire had beene very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to conclude, not without danger of a breach, by reaſon of the euill offices done by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers perſons. That in the end the difficulties were reſtrained to two: the one, to ſend an <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> before the
<hi>Cenſures</hi> were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; the other, to reeſtabliſh the
<hi>Ieſuites.</hi> That the former was eaſily ended, the <hi>Pope</hi> being contented that the <hi>Cenſures</hi> ſhould firſt be taken away: but the ſecond was not in ſuch ſort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, but that he muſt ſpeake more thereof
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:17285:220"/> with his <hi>Serenity.</hi> Then he paſſed to explane the Conditions and the forme, how the <hi>Cenſures</hi> were to be taken away. The Conditions were; That the <hi>Religious</hi> gone forth of the
<hi>State</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the <hi>Interdict</hi> ſhould be reſtored, and their goods redeliuered. That the Priſoners ſhould bee conſigned without proteſting: That the Proteſtation of the <hi>Republique</hi> ſhould be reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, with al that had followed, as alſo the <hi>Letter</hi> writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the Cities of the <hi>State,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed. He made veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for the reeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the
<hi>Ieſuites,</hi> aſſuring them not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that he could take away the <hi>Cenſures</hi> without this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, but vſing words very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſiue &amp; ful of affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he ſaid, that this would make an entire Agreement, as a thing deſired by the <hi>Pope</hi> for his reputation, by the <hi>Moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an King,</hi> for the ſatisfaction of his
<hi>Holineſſe,</hi> and to him (who ſpake) more deare than the gaine of a
<hi>Kingdome,</hi> for the ſame Reaſons: That he would counſell the
<hi>Republique</hi> to doe it, that they might ſettle a firme and durable Peace. The <hi>Duke</hi> and the <hi>Colledge</hi> immediatly anſwered, that the reſolution to giue the Priſoners to the <hi>King</hi> to gratifie him, without preiudice of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Republique</hi> had beene accepted by his
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:17285:221"/> 
               <hi>Maieſty,</hi> and therefore could not now be called into doubt: alſo that he ſhould not hope in any manner to obtaine from the <hi>Senate</hi> the omitting of the Proteſtation, as alſo the reſtitution of the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> was a thing meerely impoſſible, becauſe of the great iniuries at all times receiued from them, and for the ſtrait conditions with which their Baniſhment had beene decreed. After this, the <hi>Cardinall</hi> paſſed to ſpeake of the forme of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the <hi>Cenſures,</hi> wherein there was ſome difficulty; For the <hi>Cardinall</hi> aſſuring himſelfe that the <hi>Republique</hi> would remaine moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in the confeſſion of their innocence, and affirmatiuely maintaine that they had not in any ſort whatſoeuer incurred the <hi>Cenſures,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly that they were reſolued to refuſe Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe they had no need of it, would yet at leaſt doe ſome action by which he might make the World beleeue that the <hi>Duke</hi> had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it. And to this effect he propoſed, to goe to the Church of
<hi>S. Marke,</hi> with the <hi>Duke</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators,</hi> and there to celebrate or aſſiſt at a <hi>Maſſe</hi> ſolemne or priuate, and in fine to giue a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, ſaying, that by this his action of cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating before the <hi>Prince,</hi> or of aſſiſting with him at a
<hi>Maſſe,</hi> Men might ſee clearely that the
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:17285:221"/> 
               <hi>Cenſures</hi> had beene taken away, by the Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which he had giuen. This forme pleaſed not, becauſe it had ſome ſemblance of an Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, whence men might infer that the
<hi>Prince</hi> confeſſed he had beene faulty. And the <hi>Duke</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in plaine termes, that as the innocence of himſelfe and the
<hi>Republique</hi> was manifeſt, and without ſhadow of fault, ſo it was meet there ſhould not appeare any ſigne of Repentance, of Remiſſion, or Abſolution. That it was well knowne what had happened to many
<hi>Princes</hi> on other occaſions, to whom ſome acts which they had done out of deuotion and Religion, had beene imputed and eſteemed to be ſo many acknowledgements of their faults. And that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily they carried in triumph the Conquered, and not ſuch as had ſtoutly defended by lawfull meanes the Authoritie giuen them by <hi>God.</hi> And when the <hi>Cardinall</hi> ſaid, that the <hi>Apoſtolique</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction ought not at any time, or in any caſe to be refuſed by thoſe who had it offered; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was made him, that this was true, and that the <hi>Republique</hi> had neuer refuſed it, nor were purpoſed to refuſe it, vnleſſe when it gaue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to beleeue a falſity; as in the preſent caſe, men might be hence occaſioned to beleeue that
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:17285:222"/> the <hi>Republique</hi> had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted ſome fault, a thing contrary to truth, being moſt aſſured of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence.</p>
            <p>Beſides this which was Treated that day by the <hi>Card.</hi> for the ſpace of foure daies, they ſent to him two <hi>Senators</hi> of the
<hi>Colledge,</hi> who treated vpon the points in queſtion, and vpon others which had ſome difficulty, touching the forme of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the
<hi>Cenſures.</hi> The <hi>Senators</hi> ſaid, that to the
<hi>Republique</hi> the word of the <hi>Card.</hi> would ſuffice. Concerning the Reſtitution of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious</hi> which were retired, they conſented ſo that it might be reciprocal, and made with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that the
<hi>Pope</hi> alſo ſhould receiue to grace them, who had perſiſted in the Seruice of the <hi>Signiory.</hi> For the Writings, they ſaid, the
<hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> would do with thoſe which had been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in their fauour, as the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould do with his. And as for the
<hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> after that the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi> were taken away, they would elect and ſend one to reſide according to the Cuſtome. For their <hi>Manifeſto,</hi> that in like manner they would take it away, after that the <hi>Monitorie,</hi> whereupon it was grounded, were taken away. And touching the <hi>Letter</hi> written to the <hi>Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> and Commonalties, that many <hi>Letters</hi> had
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:17285:222"/> beene writ according to the exigence of affaires, but that they were ſecret, neither was it reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any ſhould giue Law to a <hi>Prince</hi> what he ought to write to his
<hi>Miniſters</hi> and Subiects. That the <hi>Letter</hi> commonly ſcattered was falſe, therefore it was not needfull to ſpeake of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that it was vnder the Dignity of a <hi>Prince</hi> to Treat about forged Writings. Touching the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> that to ſpeake of their returne, was to put all that which had beene done in confuſion, in as much as for certaine the finall reſolution of the <hi>Senate</hi> was, that they ſhould be excluded.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> ſaying he had charge from the <hi>King</hi> to conſerue in effect the Libertie of the
<hi>Republique,</hi> and in appearance the Dignity of the <hi>Pope,</hi> endeuoured to perſwade the <hi>Senate</hi> to receiue a Benediction, not for Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, but as an ordinary Benediction, ſuch as the <hi>Pope</hi> ſendeth. For the Writings and their Authors, he ſaid, he would not yeeld any thing in fauour of the <hi>Republique,</hi> becauſe (ſaid he) they are matters for the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> wherein the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelfe cannot intermeddle. He propoſed further, that they ſhould ſend not one, but two <hi>Ambaſſadors,</hi> conſidering that this grace done by the
<hi>Pope</hi> merited an extraordinary thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:17285:223"/> He preſſed alſo, that they ſhould publiſh a <hi>Manifeſto</hi> wth might reuoke the former, before the
<hi>Cenſures</hi> were taken away. For the <hi>Letter</hi> which had been diuulged, howſoeuer it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, yet ſome mention might be made that it was ſuch by that act. Further, he propoſed, that it was meet to frame a Writing which ſhould containe the points which were accorded, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had brought a Formulary from <hi>Rome,</hi> without making any mention of the
<hi>Ieſuites.</hi> For ſince they were not reeſtabliſhed, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion at leaſt ought not to be ſpecified; yet if this point ſhould ſeeme ſo important, as it ought not to remaine ambiguous, that at leaſt the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their excluſion might be conceiued in as faire termes as was poſſible. But for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation vpon the deliuery of the Priſoners, the <hi>Ambaſſador Freſne</hi> decided the difficulty, ſaying, that they were for the <hi>King,</hi> and to him, as to his <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> they ought to be conſigned; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he would be contented to receiue them with the Proteſtation which the <hi>Republique</hi> ſhould make, wherein the <hi>Pope</hi> nor any others were to intermeddle.</p>
            <p>The other difficulties were againe examined in full <hi>Senate</hi> the fourteenth of the ſame <hi>Month,</hi>
               <pb n="419" facs="tcp:17285:223"/> and then Treated with the <hi>Cardinall</hi> the three dayes following; and at length all reſolued af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner;</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Cardinall</hi> ſhould declare in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, without any other Ceremonie, that the <hi>Cenſures</hi> were taken away, or that hee tooke them away, (a thing which might be done ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, though they were iudged inualide:) And at the ſame time the <hi>Duke</hi> ſhould put in his hands a reuocation of the Proteſtation. They concluded alſo vpon the forme of conſigning the Priſoners according to the aduice of <hi>Freſne;</hi> that not any act ſhould be dreſſed vpon the points of the Agreement; but that the word of the <hi>Republique</hi> on the one ſide, and of the <hi>Card.</hi> on the other, ſhould ſuffice. The reeſtabliſhment of the <hi>Religious</hi> which had retired themſelues was decreed, the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> notwithſtanding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining excluded, and beſides fourteene others of the <hi>Religious</hi> who fled not for obedience to the <hi>Pope,</hi> but to auoid the puniſhment of their crimes, it being a matter of Iuſtice that Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons ſhould be baniſhed the
<hi>State.</hi> That no mention ſhould be made of any Letter writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vnto Gouernours, but onely a <hi>Manifeſto</hi> publiſhed for the reuocation of the Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:17285:224"/> which was imprinted. And after that the
<hi>Cenſures</hi> were taken away, that they ſhould name an
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> to reſide with his <hi>Holineſſe.</hi> For other particularities that they ſhould not then be ſpoken of, but ſhould be remitted to be fairely Treated with the <hi>Pope.</hi> There remained only the forme of the <hi>Manifeſto,</hi> to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to agree vpon the termes, the <hi>Secretarie Marc Ottobon</hi> was ſent to the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> &amp; <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Freſne,</hi> who eaſily conſented vpon a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, ſaue only vpon thoſe words where it was ſaid, That <hi>the Cenſures being taken away, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation in like manner was taken away:</hi> the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi> vrging that they ought not to vſe the word <hi>taken away</hi> in the Proteſtation, but <hi>reuoked,</hi> which the <hi>Secretary</hi> would not yeeld, and reported the matter vnto the
<hi>Colledge.</hi> Who though they could not comprehend what ſubtilty might be intended in the word <hi>Reuoked,</hi> which the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall</hi> would vſe, rather than that other <hi>Taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> notwithſtanding this latter pleaſed them better, becauſe it was vſed on both parts, the word
<hi>Taken away,</hi> being employed both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the <hi>Cenſures,</hi> and of the Proteſtation. But the <hi>Cardinall</hi> declaring that he could not herein goe beyond his charge which he had from the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:17285:224"/> 
               <hi>Pope,</hi> and the <hi>Senate</hi> perceiuing not any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, leſt they ſhould ſeeme to deny it only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were inſtantly requeſted, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended in the end that the word of <hi>Reuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> ſhould be vſed. And to ſhew that all was done in one and the ſame time, it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to ſay, <hi>The Proteſtation in like manner is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked.</hi> All theſe particularities being thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and determined, and the <hi>Manifeſto</hi> dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they appointed the day the 21. of <hi>Aprill,</hi> to giue an entire accompliſhment to that which was determined, which was done in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner following.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cardinall</hi> was lodged in the Palace (ſometime) of the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Ferrara:</hi> whither <hi>Freſne</hi> that morning went by times, and <hi>Marc Ottobon</hi> the <hi>Secretary</hi> being come with two or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>Notaries</hi> of the <hi>Dukes Chancery,</hi> the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers brought <hi>Marc Antony Brandolino Valdima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino, Abbot</hi> of
<hi>Nerueſe,</hi> and <hi>Scipio Sarazin Canon</hi> of <hi>Vicenza,</hi> Priſoners, entring with all their troupe into a Chamber, where was the
<hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> accompanied with his <hi>Domeſtiques,</hi> and ſome others of the family of the <hi>Cardinall.</hi> And hauing ſaluted the
<hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> they told him, that thoſe were the Priſoners, which conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:17285:225"/> to that which had beene accorded, the moſt
<hi>Illuſtrious Prince</hi> had ſent to be deliuered to his
<hi>Excellence</hi> in gratification of the <hi>Moſt Chriſtian King;</hi> with proteſtation not to preiudice here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the authority which the
<hi>Republique</hi> hath to iudge <hi>Eccleſiastiques.</hi> The
<hi>Ambaſſador</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that ſo he receiued them. Then the
<hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> demanded ſome publique inſtrument or act hereof to be made by <hi>Girolamo Poluerin</hi> and <hi>Iohn Rizzard</hi> the <hi>Dukes Notaries,</hi> in preſence of thoſe of the <hi>Cardinals Court,</hi> and of the <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi> together with the publique Officers. This done, the Priſoners recommended themſelues to the <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> who with words of curteſie promiſed them his protection, and going out of the Chamber with the company, cauſing the Priſoners to be brought after him into a Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where the <hi>Cardinall</hi> walked, he ſaid vnto the
<hi>Cardinall;</hi> Theſe are the Priſoners which are to be deliuered to the <hi>Pope.</hi> The <hi>Cardinall</hi> poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to one neere him, ſaid, Giue them to him, who was <hi>Claudio Montano</hi> a Commiſſarie ſent by the <hi>Pope</hi> to this effect; who touched them in token of dominion and poſſeſſion, and praied the Miniſters of Iuſtice which condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them, that they would be pleaſed to keepe them for him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="423" facs="tcp:17285:225"/> This Act thus finiſhed, the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> departed with the <hi>Ambaſſador,</hi> and both went vnto the <hi>Prince,</hi> who after <hi>Maſſe</hi> was gone with the
<hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niory</hi> and the <hi>Sages</hi> into the <hi>Colledge;</hi> where all being ſet as ordinarily, the <hi>Cardinall</hi> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced theſe formall words;
<q>I reioyce very much that this happy day ſo much deſired by me is come, wherein I declare vnto your <hi>Serenitie</hi> that all the
<hi>Cenſures</hi> are taken away, as in deed they are; and I take therein much pleaſure, for the benefit which ſhall redound hereby to all
<hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> and particularly to <hi>Italy.</hi> Then the
<hi>Duke</hi> put in his hand the decree of the reuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Proteſtation.</q> And after ſome words of complement, the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> praied them to ſend their <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> with ſpeed to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo departed.</p>
            <p>The reuocation of the Proteſtation was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed vnto the ſame Prelates to whom the Proteſtation was directed, and in ſubſtance contained, That a means being found, whereby the <hi>Pope</hi> was certified of the vprightneſſe and ſincerity of the <hi>Republique</hi> in their actions, He had taken away and remoued the cauſes of the preſent differences: And alſo, as the <hi>Senate</hi> had endeuoured alwaies to entertaine a good intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:17285:226"/> with the <hi>Holy See,</hi> ſo they receiued much contentment by obtaining the effect of this their iuſt deſire, whereof they were willing to giue them notice: adioyning, that on both ſides all being executed which had been agreed on, and the <hi>Cenſures</hi> being taken away, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation in like ſort did remaine reuoked.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cardinall</hi> had determined after the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the
<hi>Prince,</hi> to goe to the <hi>Cathedrall Church</hi> of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> there to celebrate <hi>Maſſe,</hi> and the <hi>Ambaſſador Don Francis de Caſtro</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him that he might there aſſiſt; the rumor whereof going thorow the City, very much people were there aſſembled early. Wherefore many <hi>Maſses</hi> were celebrated from morning till Mid-day, as alſo the dayes before, both in that Church and in others, there was a great fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentation of <hi>Maſſes</hi> and other Diuine Offices, praying
<hi>God</hi> that what was Treated for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating of ſo great a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie, might ſucceed to his glory. The <hi>Cardinall</hi> going from the Colledge, tooke his way to <hi>S. Peters,</hi> and at the ſame time the
<hi>Count de Caſtro</hi> went to the Audience of the <hi>Prince</hi> to congratulate with him. In the meane while, the <hi>Cardinall</hi> arriued at the <hi>Cathedrall Church,</hi> where for the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:17285:226"/> of people they celebrated at three
<hi>Altars,</hi> and expected a while the comming of <hi>Don Francis de Caſtro</hi> with <hi>Don Innigo de Cardenas,</hi> alwaies continuing
<hi>Maſſe</hi> after <hi>Maſſe.</hi> At length the
<hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> being come, the <hi>Cardinall</hi> ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated in the preſence of an infinite mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
            <p>The ſame day, after dinner a bruit was ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, that that morning in the Colledge the <hi>Cardinall</hi> had giuen an abſolution; which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a great diſcontentment to ſuch as were zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the publique Honour, who were curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous quickly to diſcouer the originall of ſuch a bruit, with deſigne to haue a remedy, (ſo fixed was that reſolution in the ſpirits of the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> to ſhew conſtantly that the
<hi>Republique</hi> was not in any fault:) but this rumour was ſuddenly appeaſed, becauſe in ſeeking whence it might ariſe, they found it had beene ſcattered here and there by the <hi>French,</hi> who ſaid, that all the <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> of the Colledge being aſſembled, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, according to the cuſtome, that the <hi>Duke</hi> ſhould firſt ſit downe, then after all to take their place in order, the <hi>Cardinall</hi> made the ſigne of the <hi>Croſſe</hi> vnder his hood. Which being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, the generall diſcontent was turned
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:17285:227"/> into merriment, for as much as none is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that if this be admitted as an Abſolution, the
<hi>Eccleſiaſtiques</hi> may giue Abſolution from their
<hi>Cenſures</hi> euen to them which refuſe it, or wch do not deſire it, that none can hinder it, that they may alſo (following this doctrine) abſolue men abſent, &amp; as it ſhall ſeeme good vnto them: That if the
<hi>Card.</hi> made the ſigne of the Croſſe vnder his hood, he might haue done it more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly in his Lodging, this importing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe. It was ſufficient that the <hi>Interdict</hi> had not beene obſerued for any one moment, and that the <hi>Senate</hi> refuſed not onely abſolution, but euen all ceremonies which might haue the leaſt apparence thereof.</p>
            <p>In the euening of the ſame day the <hi>Senate</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, where they deliberated to elect an <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador</hi> to goe to
<hi>Rome,</hi> to reſide with his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi> and <hi>Francis Contarini</hi> a Knight was ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, who had beene ſent by the
<hi>Republique</hi> ſome yeeres before, with three others, to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate with this <hi>Pope</hi> for his aſſumption to the <hi>Papacie.</hi> Thus was ended this tumultuous Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire, which ſeemed impoſſible to be compoſed by Accord: and verily a great part of the good ſucceſſe ought to be aſcribed to the dexterity of
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:17285:227"/> the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> who omitting pointilles and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties, did not ſay at <hi>Venice</hi> all that which the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> had wiſhed, whereunto he ſaw clearely they would neuer haue conſented.</p>
            <p>Many were of opinion that it was meet to ſend Extraordinary
<hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> into <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> to thanke thoſe <hi>Kings</hi> who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed and employed themſelues for an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, eſpecially conſidering the quality of the Miniſters whom they had herein vſed, whereof the one was very eminent, as being the moſt ancient <hi>Cardinall,</hi> the other as <hi>Nephew</hi> of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lerma.</hi> This aduice pleaſed the general, as being grounded vpon termes of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and acknowledgment of obligation. Wherefore the
<hi>Senate</hi> put it in deliberation, where balancing the reaſons which incouraged to doe this, with others which diſſwaded it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was to giue too much reputation to the Affaire, and to make the world beleeue that the <hi>Republique</hi> thought themſelues well deliuered from a merited danger; this ſole reſpect had ſo much weight, that they reſolued all with one voice, that it would ſuffice to doe ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement by the ordinary <hi>Ambaſſadors.</hi> Likewiſe many expected in <hi>Venice</hi> they ſhould make bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:17285:228"/> and other ſignes of ioy, or at leaſt ring their bells: Notwithſtanding, nothing of this was done, nor one bell founded neither at <hi>Venice</hi> nor in any Citie of the <hi>State</hi> when the News arriued. Not that the <hi>Senate</hi> and the Cities of the <hi>State</hi> were not very glad to be freed from the danger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Warre, but to the end that ſuch ſignes of ioy might not be interpreted to ſignifie ſome abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution which they had receiued, or the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> thereby conceiued to haue beene formerly in a fault; which, as an vntruth and falſhood, they euer abhorred.</p>
            <p>Moreouer by order of <hi>Senate</hi> aduice was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of this Agreement, and of all that had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> and to the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi> of the <hi>Republique</hi> in all <hi>Courts,</hi> and to the <hi>Gouernours</hi> of Cities in the
<hi>State,</hi> and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Secretary Padauin,</hi> who (beſides this aduice) had commandement to diſmiſſe the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Lorraine</hi> Souldiers, and charge alſo ſpeedily to depart from
<hi>Lorraine,</hi> and to goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Suiſſerland</hi> to make there a Leuy of 3000. men. Afterward, the <hi>Senate</hi> writ <hi>Letters</hi> to the
<hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine:</hi> but to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Great Britaine</hi> they gaue very many thankes, as he merited for his ready declaration to aſſiſt the
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:17285:228"/> 
               <hi>Republique</hi> with forces when they ſhould haue need. Further, a Preſent was giuen to the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall</hi> of 6000. crownes of ſiluer, and another to <hi>Don Francis de Caſtro</hi> of 3000.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Rome</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> had aduice, how the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was accompliſhed, how the <hi>Cardinall de Ioyeuſe</hi> had trauailed therein, and the Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reuoked; which did not pleaſe him in that clauſe, <hi>That the Proteſtation was in like ſort reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</hi> As alſo it did not pleaſe the <hi>Court,</hi> who howſoeuer they approued that which the <hi>Pope</hi> had done, yet they deſired that, according to the cuſtome, the end had beene with the victory of that <hi>See,</hi> which in matters of Affaires was euer wont to be the Conquerour. And indeed, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny offices and purſuits were done by diuers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and for diuers ends, to raiſe herein ſome new difficulties. But his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> abhorring theſe troubles, approued that which was done and writ thereof to the <hi>Cardinall de Ioyeuſe.</hi> And the 30. of <hi>Aprill</hi> declared in
<hi>Conſiſtory</hi> how the Accord was finiſhed, and Peace concluded; The
<hi>Cardinall Colonna</hi> was forward to ſpeake ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to the contrary, and the <hi>Cardinall du Perron</hi> anſwered him in few words; and nothing was ſaid further.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="430" facs="tcp:17285:229"/> The aduice of the Agreement being come to
<hi>Milan,</hi> the <hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> made ſhew that he beleeued it not, and fained to be more actiue than euer in the preparations of warre. Which he did to the end that they of <hi>Milan</hi> might not complain of the damages which they receiued, and leſt the Souldiers knowing that they muſt be disbanded, ſhould make inſtance to be paied, eſpecially for that the
<hi>Germanes</hi> and <hi>Suiſſes</hi> had couenanted to haue pay for three
<hi>Months,</hi> which would ariſe to the ſumme of 300000. crownes. In the meane while his purſe was emptie, and he was indebted 50000 crownes to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for lodgings. But when the <hi>Secretary</hi> of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> (by order from the <hi>Senate)</hi> gaue him parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular notice of the Agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he anſwered cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, neuertheleſſe with ſmall contentment, and he could not containe himſelfe when he was prayed from the
<hi>Pope</hi> to diſmiſſe his troups but anſwered harſhly, that he knew very well what he had to doe.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Venice</hi> the <hi>Cardinall de Ioyeuſe</hi> being aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed of the diſpleaſure which the <hi>Pope</hi> concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by reaſon of ſome termes contained in the <hi>Manifeſto,</hi> prayed that they would ſomewhat temper the matter by their <hi>Letters</hi> which the
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:17285:229"/> 
               <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> ſhould carry vnto the <hi>Pope</hi> and to the <hi>Cardinals;</hi> exhorting the
<hi>Republique</hi> in the Name of the <hi>King</hi> to a good intelligence with his <hi>Holineſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Rome</hi> after this there was a bruit that the <hi>Pope</hi> would not reſt contented with that that had paſſed, for that hauing weighed all things, he found that the Proteſtation was not reuoked by the termes of the <hi>Manifeſto;</hi> and that hee would not endure that any
<hi>Religious</hi> ſhould reſt excluded, for as much as this was to confirme the authority of the <hi>Republique</hi> to iudge them: and therefore that hee menaced to retract all. That the <hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> did offer him 30000. men to force the <hi>Republique</hi> vnto that which he deſired: all which bruits a little terrified the <hi>Card. de Ioyeuſe.</hi> But the
<hi>Pope</hi> was far enough from any ſuch thoughts, on the contrary he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned <hi>Rimini</hi> to be his <hi>Nuntio</hi> at <hi>Venice.</hi> And the <hi>Venetian Senate</hi> diſpatched the Lord <hi>Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini</hi> the 9 of
<hi>May,</hi> with order that he ſhould goe alone to Audience, leſt any ſhould thinke to lead him in triumph. Preſently after his arriuall hee had Audience of his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> the 19. of <hi>May,</hi> where he was benignely receiued, the <hi>Pope</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying that he would neuer after remember any
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:17285:230"/> thing that had paſſed, taking vp that word of Scripture, <hi>Recedant uetera, noua fint omnia.</hi> Alſo he exhorted the
<hi>Senate</hi> ſince they had in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſo great an Army to thinke vpon aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Turke.</hi> There was publiſhed in Print a ſheet of paper, containing the Articles of the Accord, full of notorious forgeries, whereof the Author was thought to be the <hi>Cardinal Caè<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> becauſe it was certaine that he ſent many Copies to
<hi>Milan,</hi> with his Letters to <hi>Captaine Sceuerolla;</hi> which was alſo yet more probable, becauſe he was alſo the Author of a Diſcourſe made vnder the name of <hi>Nicomachus Philale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teus,</hi> in matter and forme much like the other. The foreſaid paper was carried into <hi>France,</hi> where it was prohibited by the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Moſt Chriſtian King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 2. of <hi>Iune</hi> the <hi>Nuntio</hi> arriued at
<hi>Venice,</hi> where he was receiued according to the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie cuſtome.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, <hi>Don Francis de Caſtro</hi> quickly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Agreement diſpatched a <hi>Carrier</hi> to his <hi>King,</hi> and gaue him account of what had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which was receiued in that <hi>Court</hi> with an extreme pleaſure. The <hi>King</hi> thought himſelfe freed of a great trouble. To the <hi>Nobility</hi> it was
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:17285:230"/> very acceptable, not onely to ſee themſelues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from Warre, but further becauſe they hoped that this example would moderate the purchaſes of <hi>Eccleſiaſtiques</hi> in
<hi>Caſtile</hi> of ſuch goods as they call <hi>Patrimoniall di Radice,</hi> as they haue beene moderated in <hi>Portugall</hi> and in
<hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon:</hi> the thing being certaine that within the laſt 40. yeares the <hi>Regulars</hi> alone haue acquired to the ſumme of 250000. Crownes in goods, in that one Kingdome.</p>
            <p>After that the <hi>Currier</hi> of <hi>Don Francis</hi> was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued, came another <hi>Currier</hi> expreſly ſent by the
<hi>Senate,</hi> and carrying a commandement to their <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> to doe his complements to the <hi>King.</hi> And when the <hi>Nuntio</hi> receiued no order touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Matters for many daies after, the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lerma</hi> made great complaint vnto him, that the
<hi>Pope</hi> made ſmall account of ſo great a <hi>King,</hi> who with ſo much expence had maintained the authority of the <hi>Apoſtolique See.</hi> Order was alſo giuen immediatly to the <hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> that he ſhould diſarme, who either for want of money, or for ſome particular deſigne which he had, or becauſe he had a cuſtome not to obey the firſt commandement, ſaying that they who are far off doe not ſee neceſſities, did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:17285:231"/> his Companies: on the contrary, he put them vpon the ſhoulders and charge of the Communalties. Of which grieuance when they aduiſed the <hi>King,</hi> praying to be eaſed, (the ſole Communalty of <hi>Milan</hi> being herein at the coſt of 7000. Crownes a day) the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> was forced to write againe vnto him with his owne hand, yet warily and not with abſolute command, leſt he ſhould hazard his Royall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. But becauſe it was come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>King,</hi> that if the <hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> remained any longer in Armes, there muſt needs follow ſome inconuenience, ſince he diſguſted all the Cities of the <hi>State</hi> by meanes of thoſe Lodgings contrary to their priuiledges, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he pretended they owed him thanks for interrupting and violating the Priuiledges of the great City <hi>Milan,</hi> without Sedition,) they tooke a reſolution to command him abſolutely. For they of the <hi>Councell</hi> (who did not like to ſee any ſtirs in
<hi>Italy,)</hi> conſidered that this Accord had not onely deliuered them from the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of a Warre full of great dangers, but was further alſo profitable vnto them for the Inconueniences which might haue hapned by the humors of the <hi>Count,</hi> being giddy-headed
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:17285:231"/> and hard to be gouerned, and by the
<hi>Popes</hi> inconſtancy, much wauering in his delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
            <p>The 12. of <hi>May, Don Inigo de Cardenas</hi> gaue aduice vnto the
<hi>Duke</hi> of this laſt commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment giuen to the <hi>Count de Fuentes,</hi> that hee ſhould preſently by all meanes diſarme; and demanded paſſage thorow the <hi>Dominions</hi> of the <hi>Republique,</hi> for the <hi>Germans</hi> vnder <hi>Madruccio,</hi> to returne vnto their Houſes. Which was freely granted, prouided that they ſhould paſſe in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and without Armes. 1500. of them deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to paſſe by the
<hi>Griſons,</hi> but the paſſage being denied them, they were conſtrained to take their way by the <hi>Lac de Garde</hi> within the
<hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Republique.</hi> It is certaine, that the expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces made by reaſon of theſe motions, &amp; among the <hi>Griſons</hi> by
<hi>Fuentes,</hi> amounted to the ſumme of 800000. Crownes, not accounting the Charge of the Communalties of the Cities and Countrey, which was ineſtimable.</p>
