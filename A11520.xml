            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For if any one did reply again≈øt him with rea≈øon, or contradict his di≈øcour≈øes vpon this ≈øubject, his ordinary an≈øwer was (as if it had beene a forme of ≈øpeech or a le≈ø≈øon giuen him) here I am <hi>Pope,</hi> and I will be obeyed. But the <hi>Pope</hi> did not crect this

               </gap>as afterward a≈ø≈øailed with a grieuous melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, accompanied with a ≈øtrong apprehen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of death, which he feared would ≈øeaze vpon him within a few dayes. This feare was more encrea≈øed by a rumour di≈øper≈øed thorow <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Image of our <hi>Lady de Subiacco</hi> had ≈øweated; which v≈øually happens (as the vulgar beleeue) for to aduerti≈øe the <hi>Popes</hi> that their death is at hand. And further, a <hi>Flemmi≈øh Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger</hi> had foretold that in
<hi>March Pope Clement</hi> 8. was to die, and that after him ≈øhould be elected one <hi>Leo,</hi> and then one <hi>Paul,</hi> who ≈øhould liue but a ≈øhort time. Be≈øides, this <hi>Pope</hi> by nature was timorous, and much inclined to giue credit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Diuinations, which he entertained vpon all occurrences and accidents. This perturbation of ≈øpirit held him fiue
<hi>Months</hi> in ≈øuch extremitie, that all things affrighted him; in ≈øo much that he di≈ømi≈ø≈øed his <hi>Cooke</hi> and his <hi>Caruer,</hi> who had
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17285:14"/> long time ≈øerued him; and if any per≈øons of ba≈øe and meane condition and vnknowne, did pre≈øent him with any memoriall or petition as hee pa≈ø≈øed the ≈øtreets, very often hee let them fall to the ground, fearing le≈øt they might bee empoy≈øoned. Being thus vexed with ≈øu≈øpitions, his de≈øigne touching the enlargement of

            <p>But in the <hi>Month</hi> of <hi>September</hi> after his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion to the <hi>Papacie,</hi> his friends and kin≈ømen found a remedie for this feare; hauing made a great a≈ø≈øembly of all the <hi>A≈øtrologers</hi> and other Fortune-tellers of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the hou≈øe of the <hi>Lord Iohn Francis,</hi> brother to his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe,</hi> who concluded by their rules that the time of ≈øome perils threatned by the influences was pa≈øt, and that therefore he might now liue many yeares. His feare being thus remoued, he re≈øumed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine his fir≈øt and ordinary thoughts of aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the
<hi>Eccle≈øia≈øticall</hi> iuri≈ødiction.</p>
            <p>He began to moue the mo≈øt <hi>Chri≈øtian King</hi> that the
<hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> might be receiued in his Kingdome. In
<hi>Spaine</hi> he procured that the <hi>Ie≈øuites</hi> might be exempted from paying any Tithes. At <hi>Naples</hi> he wrought in ≈øuch ≈øort that <hi>Iohn Francis de Ponte Marqui≈øe</hi> of <hi>Morcone,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

            <p>But none of the≈øe attempts ≈øucceeding to his minde, in the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> two occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions were offered, not only of them≈øelues very
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17285:15"/> proper for the end which the <hi>Pope</hi> pretended, but very commodious, as being ≈øo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and meanes to open him a pa≈ø≈øage to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter matters. The one was, that the
<hi>Republique</hi> of <hi>Luca</hi> con≈øidering that many of their Citizens hauing changed their Religion, had retired them≈øelues into Prote≈øtant countries; in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they had publi≈øhed an <hi>Edict,</hi> by which all their ≈øubjects were forbidden to haue any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, or to treat in any fa≈øhion what≈øoeuer with ≈øuch per≈øons: an <hi>Edict</hi> which doubtle≈ø≈øe had beene highly commended by ≈øome former <hi>Popes.</hi> But this man, after it had beene repre≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him, approued the law in it ≈øelfe; but ≈øaid neuerthele≈ø≈øe that the <hi>Republique</hi> of
<hi>Luca</hi> had no authority to make any ≈øuch ordinance which touched
<hi>Religion</hi> (how≈øoeuer it were in it ≈øelfe good and holy,) for as much as <hi>Laiques</hi> haue not any power to decree in matter of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, although the Law be in fauour thereof. And therefore he ab≈øolutely commanded that the <hi>Edict</hi> ≈øhould be ra≈øed out of their Records, hauing an intention to make another (the ≈øame in ≈øub≈øtance) but to publi≈øh it by his <hi>Pontificall</hi> authoritie. The other was, that the
<hi>Republique</hi> of <hi>Genoa</hi> being aduerti≈øed that the Gouernours
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17285:16"/> of certaine <hi>Lay Fraternities,</hi> in≈øtituted by deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had not di≈øpen≈øed the Reuenew with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui≈øite fidelitie, re≈øolued to examine and renew their accounts; and to this effect commanded that the Bookes ≈øhould bee brought vnto the <hi>Duke.</hi> And in the ≈øame Citie there happened a thing of much greater importance, occa≈øioned by a new in≈øtitution of an <hi>Oratorie</hi> of <hi>Secular</hi> per≈øons, in the Hou≈øe of the <hi>Ie≈øuites,</hi> for <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian</hi> exerci≈øes; wherein they of that <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> con≈øpired not to fauour any but of their owne <hi>Society</hi> in the di≈øtribution of
<hi>Magi≈øtracies.</hi> Whereof the <hi>State</hi> hauing notice, by publique authoritie they tooke order to prohibite all ≈øuch A≈ø≈øemblies. The≈øe Decrees (which indeed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the pietie of that <hi>Republique,</hi> as de≈øirous to prouide again≈øt the euill husbanding of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall goods giuen to pious v≈øes, and to preuent all vnlawfull conuenticles and a≈ø≈øemblies, which vnder pretext of Religion tend to the ruine of <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mmon-wealths,)</hi> were not expounded in the true ≈øence, nor well accepted by the <hi>Pope;</hi> but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily he was much offended, and gaue the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi> to vnder≈øtand, that the≈øe Ordinances were again≈øt the <hi>Liberty Eccle≈øia≈øtical,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expre≈ø≈øely he enioyned them to reuoke their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17285:16"/> 
               <hi>Edicts,</hi> otherwi≈øe he threatned to thunder out his Cen≈øures. Hee made great in≈øtance to the <hi>State</hi> of
<hi>Venice,</hi> that they would ≈øuccour the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> with money for the warre of <hi>Hungarie</hi> again≈øt the <hi>Turke,</hi> offering him≈øelfe (in ca≈øe the <hi>Senate</hi> ≈øhould make difficultie, for feare of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoking again≈øt them≈øelues ≈øo pui≈ø≈øant an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie) to receiue it ≈øecretly, and pa≈ø≈øe it vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, that it ≈øhould not be perceiued. In which treatie hee and his <hi>Nuntio</hi> v≈øed a forme of di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe, not like as when one <hi>Prince</hi> repre≈øents vnto another their common intere≈øts, but like one which demandeth ≈øome extraordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions from his ≈øubiects. And therefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ≈øome mode≈øt words of an≈øwer, at la≈øt for a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall re≈øolution the <hi>Senate</hi> ≈øaid, that, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeruation of their <hi>E≈øtates</hi> they were forced to make great expen≈øes, and to prouide for many diffidences, which hindred that they could not apply them≈øelues to any new enterpri≈øes; that it was nece≈ø≈øary fir≈øt of all to ≈øettle a perfect intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence among <hi>Chri≈øtian Princes,</hi> to the end that hauing quitted all ≈øu≈øpitions, they might (being well vnited) entend the oppre≈ø≈øion of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemie; that when≈øoeuer any ouerture vnto a good Vnion ≈øhould be offered, the

<hi>Nuntio</hi> in <hi>Venice,</hi> and of him≈øelfe at <hi>Rome</hi> to the
<hi>Emba≈ø≈øador</hi> of the <hi>Signiory.</hi> After, comming to particulars, hee mentioned ≈øome affaires concerning Nauigation, and the impo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpon oyles, and touching an exchange on the coa≈øt of

            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:17285:18"/> The occa≈øion was, that at <hi>Vicenza,</hi> one <hi>Scipio Sarraceno, Canon</hi> there of a <hi>Church</hi> (who had with great contempt defaced the Seale of the <hi>Magi≈øtrate,</hi> which was put to, for the cu≈øtodie of the <hi>Bi≈øhops Court</hi> of <hi>Chancery,</hi> at the reque≈øt of the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> the <hi>See</hi> being vacant,) did his vtmo≈øt endeuour to ≈øeduce a <hi>Damo≈øell</hi> his kin≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman; and preuailing not with her, after he had long mole≈øted and pur≈øued her in publique, and euen in the <hi>Church,</hi> at la≈øt in a de≈øpitefull outrage, he ≈øhamefully defiled her portall and hou≈øe doores with his excrements: for which cau≈øe, being a≈ø≈øi≈øted by ≈øome Gentlemen of her family, ≈øhe came to <hi>Venice,</hi> and there put in her complaint again≈øt this <hi>Canon,</hi> who being called, readily pre≈øented him≈øelfe. The

            <p>In the meane while, they of <hi>Genoa,</hi> for to ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the

            <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> beleeued that by this example the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> would bee induced toyeeld (without v≈øing any reply) to his de≈øires; ≈øtrongly conceiuing that they would willingly abandon their liberty to auoid their trouble, e≈øpecially, if they were taken before they had time to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate.

The <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øented to his
<hi>Holine≈ø≈øe,</hi> that the 26. of <hi>March</hi> (on which day the Law was made) could not fall within the <hi>Holy weeke</hi> of that yeare; con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that <hi>Ea≈øter day</hi> was then the tenth of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17285:20"/> 
               <hi>April;</hi> and praied him that, ≈øince he had required him to write of the≈øe particularities to <hi>Venice,</hi> and had giuen charge vnto the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øadors</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary to treat thereof by word of mouth, he would expect an an≈øwer before hee determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned any thing in this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe. This ≈øtayed the <hi>Pope</hi> for a little time: till that about the middle of <hi>Nouember,</hi> the
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> hauing receiued an≈øwer to all that which he had written by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> (although he had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of what the Extraordinary <hi>Amba≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> had treated,) he made remon≈øtrance vnto him, following the commandement which hee had from the <hi>Senate;</hi> that the iu≈øt title and po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øion which the
<hi>State</hi> hath to iudge <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> per≈øons in cau≈øes criminall, were founded on the naturall power of a Soueraigne
<hi>Prince,</hi> and on cu≈øtome neuer interrupted by the ≈øpace of a thou≈øand yeares, and approued by the <hi>Breues</hi> of <hi>Popes</hi> them≈øelues, yet extant in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique <hi>Archiues:</hi> ≈øhewing further, that the Law again≈øt the alienation of <hi>Lay</hi> goods to the
<hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi> had not beene made only at <hi>Venice,</hi> but was al≈øo receiued and e≈øtabli≈øhed in the greater part of the cities of their
<hi>E≈øtate;</hi> and for the re≈øt which had it not, it was their dutie to follow the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17285:20"/> of the Soueraigne and Capitall Citie. He ≈øhewed likewi≈øe the equitie of that Law, and how nece≈ø≈øary it was in the≈øe times for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeruation of the ≈øtrength of their
<hi>State,</hi> by many rea≈øons and examples of ≈øundry <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and euen of ≈øome Cities within the <hi>State Eccle≈øia≈øticall.</hi> The <hi>Pope</hi> heard this di≈øcour≈øe with impatience, turning him≈øelfe from one ≈øide to another, and te≈øtifying by the outward ge≈øtures of his face and body, how grieuou≈øly he did re≈øent it within; and then he an≈øwered, that the rea≈øons alledged were friuolous; that for to iudge of an affaire it was to no purpo≈øe to ground it vpon cu≈øtome, which is often ≈øo much the wor≈øe as it is more ancient. And for the <hi>Breues,</hi> he ≈øaid there was no other <hi>Archiue</hi> of the
<hi>Breues</hi> of <hi>Popes,</hi> but that at <hi>Rome,</hi> that tho≈øe which they pretended in fauour of their cau≈øe were but wa≈øte papers, and that he would lay any wager they had not any authentique <hi>Breues</hi> in this matter. For the Law, he ≈øaid, that hauing pa≈ø≈øed his youth in the Schooles, and after that practi≈øed in the Offices of <hi>Vice-Legat,</hi> of
<hi>Auditor</hi> of the <hi>Chamber,</hi> and of Grand <hi>Viccar</hi> of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> he was become well ver≈øed and of good vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding in the≈øe bu≈øine≈ø≈øes: ≈øo that he knew
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17285:21"/> certainly that this Law was of it≈øelfe inualid, as was likewi≈øe the other of the yeare MD XXX VI: that the power ouer his owne goods belongs to each man, ≈øo that he may freely di≈øpo≈øe of them, neither can that freedome be re≈øtrained without tyrannie: that the
<hi>Senate</hi> it ≈øelfe e≈øteemed it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iu≈øt, forbidding to giue a copie thereof to any per≈øon; that if el≈øe-where were any ≈øuch like Lawes, they had beene made by authoritie of <hi>Popes;</hi> that it pertained not vnto the
<hi>Venetians</hi> to gouerne the <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øticall State,</hi> but to the <hi>Pope,</hi> who might appoint and ordaine what him≈øelfe plea≈øed in that <hi>State;</hi> and that hee would be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed. In all this, the
<hi>Pope</hi> ob≈øerued not (≈øuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him≈øelfe to be tran≈øported by his vehement pa≈ø≈øion) that whil≈øt he de≈øired to defend the
<hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle≈øia≈øticall</hi> liberty he gaue vnto <hi>Secular</hi> men too great a licence to di≈øpo≈øe of their goods at their plea≈øure, without any re≈øtraint or re≈øpect of Lawes; &amp; by calling that a tyrannie, which was indeed a iu≈øt limitation, he principally branded the <hi>Popes</hi> them≈øelues, guilty of the ≈øame exce≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> not content with the≈øe difficulties, added yet another; vnder≈øtanding that the <hi>Count Brandolino Valdemarino, Abbot</hi> of <hi>Nerue≈øe,</hi> was impri≈øoned, hee commanded that both this
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17285:21"/> 
               <hi>Abbot</hi> and the <hi>Canon</hi> ≈øhould bee deliuered into the hands of his <hi>Nuntio.</hi> Be≈øides, he heard of another Ordinance made in the yeare MDC III. whereby was prohibited the building of any new <hi>Church</hi> without the permi≈ø≈øio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of the
<hi>Senate;</hi> which he blamed with rude and violent termes. At la≈øt, he concluded with the≈øe words; Euen the Heretique <hi>Moulin</hi> ≈øaith that
<hi>≈øapit haere≈øim.</hi> Hee adioyned further, that the <hi>State</hi> retained 500000. crownes of <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øticall</hi> Legacies; and charged that in all the≈øe particulars they ≈øhould giue him ≈øatisfaction. The
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> an≈øwered that <hi>God</hi> had not giuen to
<hi>Popes</hi> any greater au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Gouernment of their
<hi>E≈øtate,</hi> then to other <hi>Princes,</hi> who by the Law of Nature haue all power which is nece≈ø≈øary. And as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth not to the
<hi>Venetians</hi> to Gouerne the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> no more doth it appertaine to <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øtiques</hi> to Gouerne the
<hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice.</hi> That the Law had not beene kept ≈øo ≈øecret, ≈øince it was publi≈øhed in all their Cities, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regi≈øtred in the <hi>Chanceries,</hi> where any one might haue a Copie. Moreouer, he ≈øhewed clearly how fal≈øe a ≈øugge≈øtion it was that the <hi>State</hi> re≈øerued any portion of Legacies <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øticall;</hi> adding further, that if his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> would examine all
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17285:22"/> the Lawes of their <hi>Signiory,</hi> and giue credit to ≈øuch calumnies as might be ca≈øt vpon them by their ill willers, the differences would grow infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. Here the <hi>Pope</hi> ≈øtayed him, and ≈øaid that for the 500000. crownes his an≈øwer had ≈øatisfied him, and that he would not multiply differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but re≈øtraine them to three heads, that is, to wit, to the Ordinance touching the building of <hi>Churches;</hi> to the Law again≈øt the alienning of <hi>Lay</hi> mens goods vnto
<hi>Eccle≈øia≈øtiques;</hi> and to the iudgement of the cau≈øes of the
<hi>Canon</hi> and the <hi>Abbot.</hi> In all the≈øe three he would be obeyed, adding that they ≈øhould not thinke to draw out the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe with delayes, for if ≈øpeedily they did not ≈øatisfie him, he would v≈øe ≈øuch remedies as he thought conuenient. That he had beene placed in that Chaire for to ≈øu≈øtaine the Iuri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øticall,</hi> in defence whereof hee would e≈øteem him≈øelfe happy to ≈øpill his bloud; that for his kindred he regarded not if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ≈øtill priuate per≈øons, being re≈øolued to neglect all other re≈øpects, and to proceed in this matter to the vttermo≈øt, what≈øoeuer ≈øhould be the i≈ø≈øue. Withall againe he threatned to ≈øend a <hi>Breue</hi> exhortatory vnto the <hi>State,</hi> hauing a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigne to pa≈ø≈øe on further if he were not obeyed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:17285:22"/> This <hi>Abbot</hi> of <hi>Neral≈øe</hi> was accu≈øed to exerci≈øe a mo≈øt vniu≈øt and cruel tyranny vpon the
<hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey</hi> neare about his dwelling; taking vp the goods of any man at what price him≈øelfe was plea≈øed; and to commit vile rapes and impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with all ≈øorts of women, and withall to practi≈øe in Sorcery and other
<hi>Magicall</hi> opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. That he ≈øtudied the Art of tempering and compo≈øing of ≈øubtill poy≈øons, whereby he had wrought the death of his brother, of a <hi>Prio rie</hi> of Saint <hi>Augu≈øtines Order,</hi> and of his ≈øeruant: the≈øe two latter becau≈øe they were con≈øcious of his crimes, and the fir≈øt becau≈øe he was his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor in the

            <p>In the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> they of <hi>Genoa,</hi> by mediation of the <hi>Cardinals</hi> of that Nation (herein more moued with their particular inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øts,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17285:23"/> then with any re≈øpect which they owed to their Countrey) reuoked the Decree which they had made touching the <hi>Oratory,</hi> vpon the <hi>Popes</hi> promi≈øe that for the time to come they ≈øhould not therein treat of any thing but matters ≈øpirituall. Of this reuocation, his

<hi>Venice,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting the <hi>Senate</hi> to deliuer vp the pri≈øonners into the hands of his <hi>Nuntio,</hi> and to reuoke the two Ordinances. And propo≈øing the example of the <hi>Genuois,</hi> he ≈øaid, <hi>Sequimini paenitentes.</hi> To this the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> an≈øwered, that there was not the ≈øame rea≈øon of the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> ≈øeeing they had not ≈øeuen <hi>Cardinals</hi> their <hi>Citizens</hi> to mediate betweene them and his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe;</hi> that the things were very different, con≈øidering that the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the <hi>State</hi> were very nece≈ø≈øary for the good Gouernment of it; that they were well knowne to his Predece≈ø≈øors, who (before their election to the <hi>Papacie)</hi> had liued at <hi>Venice</hi> in qualitie either of <hi>Confe≈ø≈øors,</hi> or of
<hi>Inqui≈øitors,</hi> or of <hi>Nuntio's:</hi> and that after their promotion they did not que≈øtion or di≈øproue them. To the≈øe rea≈øons the
<hi>Pope</hi> replied, that if the lawes of alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and of erecting
<hi>Churches,</hi> were nece≈ø≈øary, him≈øelfe would make them, hauing power to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17285:23"/> doe that which is not lawfull for <hi>Secular Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> that if they would haue recour≈øe to him, they might finde him very ready to impart all kind of fauours, being willing euen to e≈øtabli≈øh the≈øe Lawes, when it ≈øhould appeare vnto him that they are nece≈ø≈øary: But that he would not endure them to iudge <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øticall</hi> per≈øons, who are not ≈øubiect vnto <hi>Princes,</hi> and whom they cannot cha≈øti≈øe, though they be rebellious; that the former <hi>Popes</hi> did not well vnder≈øtand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues; that he de≈øired to haue regard to the ≈øafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his ≈øoule, and would handle the≈øe holy bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈ø≈øes according as was meet, and as his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation required; that till then he had done the office of a Father, but now he would come to further remedies. Therefore hee purpo≈øed to ≈øend a <hi>Breue</hi> exhortatory concerning the three points afore≈øaid, and if he were not obeied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a time, which he would prefix, he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed further; becau≈øe he had power ouer all, and could depriue <hi>Kings,</hi> and to this end had legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Angels</hi> for his aid and a≈ø≈øi≈øtants. The <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈ø≈øador</hi> reque≈øted the
<hi>Pope</hi> to con≈øider that it was not meet to proceed in this matter with ≈øo much precipitation, ≈øeeing it ≈øeemed not to the purpo≈øe to confound the law touching <hi>Churches,</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:17285:24"/> with that of alienation, much le≈ø≈øe yet the cau≈øe of the <hi>Canon,</hi> with that of the <hi>Abbot;</hi> e≈øpecially for that he knew not yet the intention of the <hi>State</hi> in the≈øe two points, as hauing yet receiued no an≈øwer; and exhorted his
<hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> to weigh well the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe. The <hi>Pope</hi> made an≈øwer, that him≈øelfe ought therefore to reply, that he might more ≈øpeedily know their re≈øolution.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Senate,</hi> when they had throughly weighed the affaire, and balanced on the one ≈øide the di≈ødaine and the ra≈øh proceedings of the

<hi>State,</hi> which might moue withall ≈øome perillous ≈øedition.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17285:24"/> The <hi>Senate</hi> all with one voice con≈øented vpon this re≈øolution, whereof the <hi>Nuntio</hi> was aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed. Which was al≈øo reported at <hi>Rome,</hi> to ≈øhew how well the <hi>State</hi> was vnited for defence of their libertie, and to di≈øcharge the <hi>Pope</hi> of his vaine hope that the <hi>Senators</hi> would be diuided, as the <hi>Ie≈øuites</hi> had promi≈øed him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> hauing receiued this an≈øwer by the Letters of his <hi>Nuntio,</hi> and by the mouth of the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador,</hi> did not for all this change his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigne, but remaining con≈øtant and re≈øolued what to doe, to wit, to expedite a <hi>Breue,</hi> hee was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing moued with any thing which the <hi>Amba≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øador</hi> could ≈øay of the rea≈øons and cau≈øes which had induced the <hi>Senate</hi> to make this deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of their courage and con≈øtancie to per≈øeuere therein, together with the pernicious inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences which might en≈øue, if his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> ≈øhould v≈øe any meanes of violence; but he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that two
<hi>Breues</hi> ≈øhould be di≈øpatched, the one concerning the two Lawes, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the two Pri≈øoners.</p>
            <p>At the ≈øame time there came adui≈øe to <hi>Rome</hi> of an
<hi>Edict</hi> made by the <hi>Repub.</hi> of <hi>Luca,</hi> which, to preuent great troubles occa≈øioned in that <hi>State</hi> by letters of execution ≈øent from the <hi>Auditor</hi> of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17285:25"/> the <hi>Apo≈øtolique Chamber,</hi> ordained that thence forward no ≈øuch letters ≈øhould haue force, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe fir≈øt they were viewed by the <hi>Magi≈øtrates.</hi> Whereat the <hi>Pope</hi> chafed beyond mea≈øure, ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it was again≈øt the libertie
<hi>Eccle≈øia≈øticall,</hi> and his plea≈øure was, that this <hi>Edict</hi> ≈øhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked, although the <hi>Agent</hi> of that <hi>Signiory</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered; that their <hi>State</hi> had herein followed the example of many
<hi>Princes,</hi> and would further follow it in their reuocation, when others ≈øhould be brought vnto it.</p>
            <p>But for the <hi>Venetian</hi> bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, it fell out that on the ninth of <hi>December</hi> (an ordinary day of audience for the
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> of the <hi>State)</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> treated very courteou≈øly with him; in ≈øuch manner as he neuer had ≈øo fauourable entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Which made him thinke that his vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence being now ≈øetled, he meant to proceed with maturity; but it happened quite contrary. For the
<hi>Pope</hi> re≈øoluing to come to action, did not any more v≈øe violent words, as by the euent appeared. The day following (10. of <hi>December)</hi> he prepared &amp; ≈øealed two <hi>Breues,</hi> addre≈ø≈øed <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino Grinani Duci, &amp; Reipub. Venetorum,</hi> which he ≈øent the ≈øame day to his <hi>Nuntio,</hi> with charge that he ≈øhould pre≈øent them. And fearing le≈øt if
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17285:25"/> this newes of the <hi>Breues</hi> ≈øent to
<hi>Venice</hi> were di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, his <hi>Me≈ø≈øenger</hi> might be ≈øtayed or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, he di≈øpatched another by the way of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi> with <hi>Copies</hi> of the two <hi>Breues</hi> vnto the ≈øame
<hi>Nuntio;</hi> but neither the one, nor the other <hi>Currier</hi> found any lett, for the <hi>Nuntio</hi> had the Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in good time. After the ≈øending of the≈øe <hi>Breues</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> called a
<hi>Con≈øi≈øtory</hi> the twelfth of the ≈øaid <hi>Moneth,</hi> wherein he declared how the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> had violated the
<hi>Eccle≈øia≈øticall</hi> Libertie, by publi≈øhing two Lawes, and detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in hold two per≈øons of the <hi>Church,</hi> dilating a little vpon each one of the three heads: yet he did not take the opinions of the
<hi>Cardinals,</hi> nor ≈øo much as permitted them to ≈øpeake; at which the
<hi>Cardinals</hi> murmured, e≈øteeming it fit not only that ≈øuch matters ≈øhould be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to them, but al≈øo that they ≈øhould thereof deliberate &amp; giue their iudgements. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oeuer were the ≈øub≈øtance of the affaire, they then with one accord agreed that the re≈øoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was ra≈øh and perillous. But afterwards when they had con≈øidered the rea≈øons of the <hi>Pope</hi> and of the <hi>State,</hi> they differed in iudgement vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter, and diuer≈øly an≈øwered the <hi>Amba≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øador</hi> of the
<hi>Signiory,</hi> who talked thereof with
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17285:26"/> diuers of them. Some ≈øaid that the
<hi>Pope</hi> ought rather to haue an eye vpon other more vrgent nece≈ø≈øities of the <hi>Church,</hi> and to omit the≈øe que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtions.
<hi>Cardinall Bellarmine</hi> ≈øaid clearely that the <hi>Pope</hi> did not ≈øpeake with him of the≈øe matters of Iuri≈ødiction, becau≈øe they knew his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment herein to be ≈øparing, and that hee exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his
<hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> rather to thinke on the Re≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Prelates in their <hi>Churches. Cardinall Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> ≈øaid, they were not wont to treat with him of the≈øe matters, becau≈øe they knew what was his accu≈øtomed an≈øwer. <hi>Cardinall Zapata,</hi> that there were in
<hi>Spaine</hi> Lawes ≈øemblable to the≈øe in que≈øtion: and <hi>Cardinall Monopoly</hi> that the Lawes might be allowed without any material alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, prouided that the <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øtiques</hi> ≈øhould not be therein mentioned. There were ≈øome that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued the Lawes, but not the Iudgements; and ≈øome againe that approued the Iudgements, but not the Lawes. It is certaine that before the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition of the <hi>Breues,</hi> out of a feare of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience, the <hi>Cardinals Baronius,</hi> and <hi>Du Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> did ≈øecretly in a priuate Audience effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly labour with the
<hi>Pope,</hi> that he would de≈øi≈øt from an enterpri≈øe ≈øo difficult and perillous; or at lea≈øt by putting it in deliberation, he would
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17285:26"/> ≈øerue him≈øelfe of time for to compa≈ø≈øe his end, and not put all in danger through precipitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:17285:34"/> In the meane while the <hi>Pope</hi> longed with an extreame de≈øire to haue their an≈øwer to his <hi>Breues,</hi> which he expected would be conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his fanta≈øie; and he could not be per≈øwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the <hi>State</hi> would haue more care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerue their Liberty, than feare of his threatnings. Which that he might make to appeare more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable, he ≈øerued him≈øelfe not only of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of them of
<hi>Genoa,</hi> but yet of one much greater. For hauing notice that the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoy</hi> had commanded the <hi>Bi≈øhop</hi> of
<hi>Fo≈ø≈øano</hi> to depart out of his Dominions (which he was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øioned to doe vpon great and important rea≈øons,) being hereby incen≈øed, he menaced the <hi>Duke</hi> with Excommunication, vnle≈ø≈øe he reuoked his commandement.</p>
            <p>At length the Letters of the <hi>Senate</hi> arriued at
<hi>Rome,</hi> and were pre≈øented by the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the
<hi>Pope,</hi> who opened them in his pre≈øence, and at the fir≈øt ≈øight was greatly moued for the errour committed in the pre≈øentation of two
<hi>Breues</hi> both of one tenor, in ≈øtead of two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; and attributed the fault herein vnto his <hi>Nuntio.</hi> And pa≈ø≈øing further in the reading of the Letter, he ≈øhewed him≈øelfe much more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. In the end, not comming to particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17285:35"/> he ≈øaid; that the Monitory <hi>Breues</hi> could not be an≈øwered, and that the an≈øwers of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> were friuolous: that the matter was cleare, and that he was peremptorily re≈øolued to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on further. He added, that lately he had heard of another Law, touching goods <hi>Eccle≈øia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øticall</hi> holden as <hi>Emphyteuticke,</hi> which his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure was ≈øhould be reuoked with the other; and although till then he had not mentioned this Law (becau≈øe he knew not of it,) yet hee had more to ≈øay again≈øt it, than again≈øt all the other; that it behoued in all the≈øe things to obey him, becau≈øe his cau≈øe was the cau≈øe of
<hi>God, Et portae inferinon praeualebunt aduer≈øus eam.</hi> That if the
<hi>Monks</hi> of <hi>Padua</hi> or other places ≈øhould purcha≈øe more than were meet, they might haue recour≈øe to him, and that in this ca≈øe he would prouide, the <hi>Secular</hi> Authority being not herein to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medle, which the <hi>Venetians</hi> doing, were <hi>Tyrants</hi> and different fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> their Ance≈øtors. The <hi>Pope</hi> ≈øpake all this with ≈øo great heat, that the
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> did not iudge fit at that time to pa≈ø≈øe on further: wherefore after ≈øome words concerning the la≈øt Law, he tooke leaue. But as he was going out of the Chamber of Audience, the <hi>Pope</hi> called him backe, and ri≈øing from his ≈øeat, hee tooke
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17285:35"/> him into a chamber apart: where, relea≈øing ≈øome what the ext≈ïeme rigor which hitherto he had v≈øed, he di≈øcour≈øed moderately of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten≈øions, and heard the an≈øwers of the
<hi>Amba≈øs.</hi> as ≈øhe wing him≈øelfe inclined to ≈øome compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition, and touching the Law newly que≈øtioned he concluded that he had not ≈øpoken of it if they had giuen him any ≈øatisfaction in the other two compri≈øed in the <hi>Breue</hi> which he had ≈øent. And for the Pri≈øoners, that if they rendred the <hi>Canon</hi> vnto his <hi>Nuntio,</hi> he would in fauour yeeld and deliuer the <hi>Abbot</hi> to the iudgement of the Secular Magi≈øtrate; but that this ≈øhould be done ≈øpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, becau≈øe he was an enemie of time, and would not that they ≈øhould defer in hope that the <hi>Pope</hi> might die. That if within fifteene daies he had contentment, he promi≈øed not to trouble them during his <hi>Pontificate,</hi> but if that time were expired that he would proceed. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he coun≈øelled the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> to write here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and that to this effect he meant to di≈øpatch a
<hi>Currier,</hi> as al≈øo he did. And in conformitie of this the
<hi>Nuntio</hi> ≈øpake in <hi>Senate,</hi> exhorting them with many words to giue ≈øatisfaction vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> by reuoking the two Lawes and by deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering the <hi>Canon;</hi> promi≈øing that this being
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:17285:36"/> done, from his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> they ≈øhould receiue as ample fauours as in former times had beene euer granted by the <hi>See Apo≈øtolique</hi> to any <hi>Prince.</hi> He mentioned al≈øo the Law of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyteu≈øes,</hi> which the <hi>Pope</hi> e≈øteemed more oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øite to his authoritie than the other two; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding he did not much inlarge him≈øelfe vpon this point, but left it without conclu≈øion, which cau≈øed in the <hi>Senate</hi> a great a≈øtoni≈øhment, and the
<hi>Duke</hi> not vnder≈øtanding fully his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, de≈øired of him a more ample and exact explication. But the <hi>Nuntio</hi> approching neere him, ≈øaid in his eare, that it was not needfull to pa≈ø≈øe further vpon that ≈øubject, promi≈øing on his word vnto his <hi>Highne≈ø≈øe</hi> that there ≈øhould be no more ≈øpeech of it. The <hi>Duke</hi> did not thinke fit to keepe ≈øecret this promi≈øe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he repeated aloud what the
<hi>Nuntio</hi> had ≈øaid vnto him and on his word had promi≈øed.</p>
            <p>This relea≈øe of rigor which the <hi>Pope</hi> v≈øed at
<hi>Rome</hi> and his <hi>Nuntio</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> made men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that vpon the arriuall of the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> with his
<hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> all the≈øe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates would ea≈øily be compo≈øed. The
<hi>Senate</hi> did much de≈øire that the <hi>Pope</hi> would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwaded by their rea≈øons, and therefore an≈øwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17285:36"/> the <hi>Nuntio</hi> (who earne≈øtly moued them for their re≈øolution) that <hi>Duodo</hi> ≈øhould goe to his
<hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> to repre≈øent vnto him that which had pa≈ø≈øed. But the <hi>Pope</hi> ≈øcarcely let pa≈ø≈øe the fifteene daies, when being returned to his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtomed rigor (though the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador Nani</hi> had told him that <hi>Duodo</hi> was already di≈øpatched) in the moneth of
<hi>February,</hi> he complained that they deferred ≈øo long, ≈øaying he could not in any ≈øort endure ≈øuch delay, and that he would not be tied to expect any longer. And a few daies afterward, when the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> was rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> ≈øome newes of the route of
<hi>Cicala</hi> vpon the confines of <hi>Per≈øia,</hi> he made not any reflexion vpon this narration, but think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the while vpon <hi>Duodo,</hi> he ≈øaid; Let him not come with any more rea≈øons, for you haue ≈øpoken thereof ≈øufficiently. The <hi>Pope</hi> remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned firme in his deliberation, and accordingly commanded his <hi>Nuntio</hi> to pre≈øent the other
<hi>Breue,</hi> dated the 10. of <hi>December</hi> before, and addre≈ø≈øed to
<hi>Marin Grimani Duke,</hi> and to the <hi>Republique</hi> of the
<hi>Venetians,</hi> concerning the <hi>Canon</hi> and the <hi>Abbot</hi> Pri≈øoners: which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement hee executed the 25. of <hi>February</hi> two daies after the departure of <hi>Duodo</hi> going to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17285:37"/> 
               <hi>Rome,</hi> his in≈øtructions being expedited vpon the 18. of the ≈øame <hi>Moneth.</hi> The <hi>Duke</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be much offended, that this <hi>Breue</hi> ≈øhould be deliuered two daies after the departure of an <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> ≈øent vpon this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and ≈øo much more becau≈øe it was not addre≈ø≈øed to him, but ≈øhould haue beene pre≈øented to his Predece≈ø≈øor. In this
<hi>Breue</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> ≈øaid; That he vnder≈øtood by the letters of his <hi>Nuntio</hi> and by the di≈øcour≈øes of their <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador,</hi> that the <hi>Canon</hi> and <hi>Abbot,</hi> arre≈øted hereto fore by the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the <hi>State,</hi> were ≈øtill detained, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that they had power to doe this by vertue of ≈øome Priuiledges giuen them by the <hi>See Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtolique,</hi> and by a cu≈øtome which they haue to iudge per≈øons
<hi>Eccle≈øia≈øticall;</hi> which things he would willingly ≈øuffer if they were conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ≈øacred <hi>Con≈øtitutions.</hi> But being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the holy <hi>Canons</hi> and to <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øticall</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty (which hath ground in diuine ordinance, he was forced by the dutie of his office to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerti≈øe them that their cu≈øtome was not auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as being repugnant to <hi>Canonicall</hi> in≈øtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Therefore there remained one onely ≈øcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whether the <hi>State</hi> had any priuiledge gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto them by his <hi>Predece≈ø≈øors;</hi> that herein
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17285:37"/> they ≈øhould ≈øpeake ingenuou≈øly and with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, to the end it might be examined by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe and the <hi>Rom. Church,</hi> who hereupon might giue their nece≈ø≈øarie admonitions. That they mi≈øtooke their grant, and conceiued it larger than it was indeed; becau≈øe that the <hi>Republique</hi> had ouerpa≈ø≈øed their iuri≈ødiction, as hauing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it to per≈øons and ca≈øes and places which were exempted, (whereof his <hi>Predece≈ø≈øors</hi> had ≈øometime made complaint,) and by con≈øequent had forfeited their Priuiledges, as not ob≈øeruing the conditions pre≈øcribed when they were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For which rea≈øons he commanded vnder paine of Excommunication <hi>latae ≈øententiae,</hi> that ≈øpeedily the
<hi>Canon</hi> and the <hi>Abbot</hi> ≈øhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered into the hands of his <hi>Nuntio,</hi> who ≈øhould cha≈øti≈øe them according to the grauitie of their crimes, le≈øt any ≈øhould thinke that his Mini≈øters would abu≈øe their <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øticall</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie and exemptions: and all men knew that he intended that the <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øtiques</hi> ≈øhould giue example of goodne≈ø≈øe to all others. That if the Secular Officers had already proceeded to any acts or ≈øentences of condemnation or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, he did annull them and declare them void, threatning that if he were not obeyed, or
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17285:38"/> if they deferred to obey him, he would proceed further, ≈øo as Iu≈øtice ≈øhould require, not purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing to neglect any thing pertaining to his charge, for the con≈øeruation of the
<hi>Eccle≈øia≈øticall</hi> iuri≈ødiction.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Senate</hi> hauing heard the contents of the <hi>Breue,</hi> although they had already con≈øulted the <hi>Doctors</hi> not onely touching the Lawes mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the <hi>Pope</hi> in his other <hi>Breue,</hi> but al≈øo touching the que≈øtion of iudging <hi>Eccle≈øia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtiques,</hi> which his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> fir≈øt of all quarrelled, as hath beene ≈øaid: and though they were by them re≈øolued that the cu≈øtome practi≈øed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all memorie in the <hi>State</hi> was lawfull and well grounded; yet neuerthele≈ø≈øe le≈øt any thing might be neglected, which might helpe to cleare the≈øe difficulties, againe they a≈ø≈øembled the ≈øame
<hi>Doctors</hi> which re≈øided in <hi>Venice,</hi> or other parts, and required their opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the contents of this <hi>Breue,</hi> what an≈øwer were fit to be made. Vpon which con≈øultation, and after they had duely examined all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances, the <hi>Senate</hi> an≈øwered the
<hi>Pope</hi> the 11. of <hi>March</hi> in the≈øe termes: That the
<hi>Breue</hi> of his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> had beene read with great reuerence, but not without great griefe, as thereby percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17285:38"/> that the≈øe matters of di≈øcord did euery day increa≈øe, and that his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> purpo≈øed to de≈øtroy the Lawes of their <hi>Republique,</hi> which till this age ≈øo long had beene pre≈øerued intire. For to command them to deliuer vp vnto his <hi>Nuntio</hi> the <hi>Canon</hi> and the <hi>Abbot,</hi> was nothing el≈øe but to demand that they ≈øhould de≈øpoyle them≈øelues of their iu≈øt power to cha≈øti≈øe crimes and wickedne≈ø≈øe, which power they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed (euen with the approbation of <hi>Popes)</hi> from the originall of their

That the precedent <hi>Popes</hi> had herein approued them, and if ≈øome one among them had attempted ought in preiudice of this authoritie giuen by <hi>God</hi> vnto the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique,</hi> this could not any way depriue them of their right, nor did they forbeare notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding to exerci≈øe their authoritie. That the <hi>Senate</hi> were ≈øufficiently per≈øwaded, con≈øidering the puritie of their con≈øcience in this cau≈øe, no place was left for the threatnings of his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe; </hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:17285:39"/> hoping al≈øo that he would take in good part that which the <hi>Senate</hi> anciently and of late had done in this ca≈øe for the honour of <hi>God,</hi> and in con≈øideration of the publique repo≈øe, and for the puni≈øhment of malefactors.</p>
            <p>Pre≈øently after the <hi>Pope</hi> had di≈øpatched his

<hi>Con≈øi≈øtorie,</hi> and make it there appeare, how he per≈øi≈øted in the ≈øame deliberations. Wherefore the 20. of <hi>February,</hi> the
<hi>Cardinals</hi> being a≈ø≈øembled, hee made remon≈øtrance what he had ≈øaid the fir≈øt time, and adioyned what hee had yet to ≈øay again≈øt the Law of the <hi>Emphyteu≈øes.</hi> Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele≈ø≈øe he did not permit any of the <hi>Cardinals</hi> in the≈øe points to ≈øpeake any thing, but pa≈ø≈øed on to <hi>Con≈øi≈øtoriall</hi> matters. After at the audience of the
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador,</hi> he complained of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies, and that the

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17285:39"/> that the <hi>Republique</hi> was not accu≈øtomed to defer affaires; that it ≈øeemed his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> meant to precipitate things, fora≈ømuch as in the <hi>Con≈øistorie</hi> 12. of <hi>Decemb</hi> he had complained of the <hi>Republique</hi> touching the Law again≈øt building of <hi>Churches,</hi> before he vnder≈øtood ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by word or writing what was the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Senate</hi> in that behalfe. And further, that in the la≈øt <hi>Con≈øi≈øtorie</hi> hee had made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint concerning the Law which he called of <hi>Emphyteu≈øes,</hi> of which neither him≈øelfe had written any one word, nor had commanded him to write thereof, nor cau≈øed his <hi>Nuntio</hi> to mention it. The

            <p>After the≈øe things arriued at <hi>Rome</hi> the an≈øwer of the

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:17285:40"/> quickly pre≈øented it; but the <hi>Pope</hi> not willing to reade it in his pre≈øence, as he did the other, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øaid; that the <hi>Venetians</hi> did iu≈øt like tho≈øe that ≈øtrike fir≈øt, and then complaine; that he would heare the Extraordinary <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador,</hi> but not treat with him; that if he brought him not ≈øome ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, he would pa≈ø≈øe on. He added his v≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all complaints, that they meant to delay the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire, and take the benefit of time, of which he was an enemy, not being able to endure any more prolongings. He complained be≈øides, that the
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> Extraordinary deferred too long his comming, not becau≈øe he hoped by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence to finde or admit any compo≈øition, being already re≈øolued, and fully in his minde deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to pur≈øue again≈øt the <hi>Republique</hi> the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which they had offered vnto the

But ≈øtaying only on the generall, he ≈øaid; that the exemption of the <hi>Eccle≈øiastiques</hi> was
<hi>de iure diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> and therefore he would not now content him≈øelfe with (what he formerly had propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) the re≈øtoring only of the one Pri≈øoner: that he would not meddle with things <hi>Temporall,</hi> but their three Lawes were v≈øurpations; that he was not moued with any pa≈ø≈øion, and that his cau≈øe was the cau≈øe of <hi>God:</hi> that the Ordinary
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> had often repeated vnto him the≈øe ≈øame allegations, but all were of no force: and that he would heare him to doe him a plea≈øure,

The <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> to ≈øtay a little this torrent, and to giue him time to be thinke him≈øelfe, offered to write to <hi>Venice</hi> what was his re≈øolution: wherewith the <hi>Pope</hi> was content, counting in what time the <hi>Currier</hi> might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne with an an≈øwer, and threatning that hee would not waite one moment longer.

               <hi>Duodo,</hi> as the cu≈øtome is, vi≈øited the <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,</hi> and had ≈øpeech with all of them touching the differences in que≈øtion; and although they an≈øwered differently, yet it appeared they had no great hand in the affaire, ≈øaue onely that they heard it propounded in the <hi>Con≈øi≈øtory</hi> vpon the twelfth of
<hi>December,</hi> and the twentieth of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary. Duodo</hi> did not cea≈øe in other Audiences which the <hi>Pope</hi> gaue him, to a≈ø≈øay if he could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way a≈ø≈øwage him; hoping that the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might be reduced to ≈øome termes of accord, if he might finde meanes a little to hinder his
<hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> from his headlong cour≈øes. But the <hi>Pope</hi> ≈øtill ≈øhewing him≈øelfe re≈øolute, ≈øaying that he had v≈øed a very great patience: that the <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> were ≈øtill more ob≈øtinate, and his condition euery day wor≈øe; for he vnder≈øtood how it was openly ≈øpoken in <hi>Venice,</hi> that they were not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed herein to giue him any ≈øatisfaction, that therefore he could not abandon his reputation: that in the
<hi>Senate</hi> there was not one that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtood the≈øe matters, and that they were content to con≈øult thereof with their <hi>Doctors,</hi> but that hee had written to ≈øuch Per≈øons as were able to ≈øet their
<hi>Doctors</hi> to Schoole, and concluded that he would proceed with his Spirituall Armes;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17285:42"/> but in other things he would account of the
<hi>Venetians</hi> as of his children. The <hi>Amba≈ø≈øadour</hi> hearing his re≈øolution, and knowing it would be to little effect for him to reply, retired him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe from the Audience with few words, but full of prudence and grauitie.</p>
            <p>The day following, the <hi>Cardinals</hi> of <hi>Verona</hi> and
<hi>Vicenza</hi> found meanes to in≈øinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues neere the
<hi>Pope,</hi> and to talke with him vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ≈øubiect: where they did very good and effectuall offices, exhorting his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> to v≈øe ≈øome delaies: whereto he an≈øwered, that he had deferred but too long; that the offer by him propo≈øed to the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øadour Nani,</hi> had beene e≈øteemed not worthy an an≈øwer; that he had heard the Extraordinary, although he ≈øpake big: that he had fiue and twenty or thirty Letters from
<hi>Venice,</hi> whereby hee had notice that hee could not hope for any ≈øatisfaction. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding all this, that he would yet giue terme of foure and twenty dayes, which was enough time to giue them for their repentance. The <hi>Cardinals</hi> repre≈øented vnto him with many and powerfull words what damage might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, if the Spirituall armes ≈øhould be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. To which the <hi>Pope</hi> an≈øwered, that then he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17285:42"/> would employ the Temporall. And ≈øo without communicating that which he had in minde to many per≈øons, he cau≈øed to draw vp and imprint a <hi>Monitory</hi> again≈øt the <hi>Republique;</hi> which after reuiewing and finding it not to his liking, hee changed it, and at la≈øt compo≈øed and made to be imprinted another, dated the 17. of <hi>Aprill,</hi> purpo≈øing to publi≈øh it that day in <hi>Con≈øi≈øtory.</hi> But that morning he was found very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in ≈øpirit, and perplexed what he ≈øhould do; and the houre approching, (the <hi>Cardinals</hi> being already a≈ø≈øembled) he began profoundly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider within him≈øelfe, whether to proceed as he had determined, or to deferre the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe till ≈øome other time. But the <hi>Cardinall Arrigon</hi> (who, according to the cu≈øtom of the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> which haue part in the Gouernment, was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcended into the <hi>Hall</hi> with the re≈øt, but was gone vp into the Chamber of his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> with his <hi>Nephew,</hi> for to accompany him downe,) exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him by no meanes to relent. Whereupon againe re≈øoluing vpon his former purpo≈øe, he entred the <hi>Con≈øi≈øtory,</hi> where he made recitall of his preten≈øions again≈øt the <hi>Republique,</hi> inlarging his ≈øpeech particularly vpon that Law (by him called) of Farmes
<hi>Emphyteuticke,</hi> although he
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17285:43"/> ≈øaid he had written nothing thereof to
<hi>Venice,</hi> nor tretaed of it with the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador,</hi> ≈øaue only that he had told him, he had ob≈øerued it. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned, that he had fir≈øt him≈øelfe ≈øtudyed the≈øe points, then he had conferred thereof with the mo≈øt famous <hi>Canoni≈øts,</hi> who did conclude that the ordinances of the <hi>Republique</hi> were contrary to the Authority of the <hi>See Apo≈øtolique,</hi> and to liberty <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øticall,</hi> all edging further that they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>demned by the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Pope Symma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> &amp; by that of <hi>Lyons</hi> vnder <hi>Pope Gregory</hi>

And in ca≈øe there yet remain'd any doubt, he did then declare that all the≈øe Lawes were contrary to <hi>Eccle≈øiasticall</hi> Liberty. Be≈øides he cau≈øed to be read a Con≈øtitution of <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a certaine Edict of <hi>Henry Emperiour</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantinople;</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:17285:43"/> and proceeding to ≈øpeake of crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall iudgements again≈øt per≈øons <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øticall,</hi> hee ≈øaid that the <hi>Venetians</hi> pretended to haue ≈øome priuiledges, which not with≈øtanding they did extend to places and cau≈øes not compri≈øed in them, euen again≈øt the per≈øons of <hi>Bi≈øhops.</hi> He commended further his patience, hauing ≈øo long time expected their repentance: by rea≈øon whereof he might, without further delay or granting any longer terme, come to the
<hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict;</hi> but <hi>mitius agendo,</hi> hee had deliberated to giue them re≈øpite of foure and twenty daies more; and that he might doe all things
<hi>cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically,</hi> he was content to take the voices and ≈øuffrages of the
<hi>Cardinals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon each one gaue his ≈øuffrage; and fir≈øt the

<hi>Card. d'A≈øcoli</hi> made a ≈øigne with his head that he was of the ≈øame opinion, without ≈øpeaking word which could be vnder≈øtood, as al≈øo hee had done vnder <hi>Clement</hi> 8. when the <hi>Monitorie</hi> again≈øt the <hi>Duke Cae≈øar d'E≈øte</hi> was publi≈øhed. The <hi>Card.</hi> of

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:17285:44"/> his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe,</hi> who had proceeded (he ≈øaid) in this affaire <hi>lent√¢ fe≈øtinatione;</hi> he added, that in a <hi>Senate</hi> compo≈øed of ≈øo great a number of per≈øons, as was that of <hi>Venice,</hi> things could not be di≈øpatched with ≈øuch ≈øpeedine≈ø≈øe; that it was not good to bee too ha≈øtie again≈øt a
<hi>Repub.</hi> which had well-merited; that the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe might well be yet a while deferred vpon hope thereby to gaine them, and in the meane time men might haue time to weigh their rea≈øons, and he concluded with the≈øe words,
<hi>Sed differ, habent paruae commoda magnamorae;</hi> But defer, holy Father, little delaies ≈øometime bring great commodities. At this word the
<hi>Pope</hi> interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed and ≈øaid, that he had done nothing of his owne proper iudgement; that he had adui≈øed with learned men, and beene directed by their coun≈øell. Whereupon the <hi>Card.</hi> replyed, if this were ≈øo he could not contradict that which had beene re≈øolued by his
<hi>Holine≈ø≈øe.</hi> The <hi>Cardinall Sauli</hi> ≈øaid, that the
<hi>Venetians</hi> had beene too long forborne and heard; that it was meet to v≈øe rigor again≈øt them to make them yeeld; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for his part, he thought it good to proceed with courage in this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, referring the i≈ø≈øue to <hi>God</hi> who≈øe cau≈øe was handled. The

            <p>No other thing could be expected from the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> but that they would con≈øent to the deliberations of the <hi>Pope;</hi> ≈øome by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per inclination being carried to the ≈øame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as being pa≈ø≈øionate for the <hi>Ecclefia≈øticall</hi> liberty; others becau≈øe their particular intere≈øts (by rea≈øon of the preten≈øions which they might haue vnto the <hi>Papacie)</hi> forced them to accord; others had not the boldne≈ø≈øe to contradict the <hi>Pope</hi> in any matter, le≈øt they ≈øhould ≈øo cut off
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17285:45"/> the hope of profit from them or theirs; in which regard, one of them excu≈øed him≈øelfe, ≈øaying, that if he had ≈øaid any thing again≈øt the de≈øigne of the <hi>Pope,</hi> he had much endamaged him≈øelfe without any furtherance to the <hi>Republique.</hi> And it is a thing without doubt in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the
<hi>Cardinals</hi> voices are taken in <hi>Con≈øi≈øtorie</hi> onely in apparence and by way of ceremonie, in a≈ø much as they are neuer informed of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire whereof they are to treat, but of the fact alone which is pre≈øented; or at the mo≈øt they haue no further information then tho≈øe few words which the <hi>Pope</hi> is plea≈øed to ≈øpeake two ≈øeuerall times in
<hi>Con≈øi≈øtorie,</hi> as hath beene ≈øaid. And not ≈øeldome matters are propounded whereof they neuer heard word. So that the <hi>Popes</hi> goe with a≈ø≈øurance to propound in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtorie</hi> what≈øoeuer is to their humour, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon the cu≈øtome which is among the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> to con≈øent to all that which is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed; which is openly derided in the

            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Con≈øi≈øtorie</hi> thus fini≈øhed, the
<hi>Monitorie</hi> was affixed in the accu≈øtomed places of the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and incontinently ≈øcattered euery
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:17285:46"/> where, an infinite number of <hi>Copies</hi> being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, partly in <hi>Latine,</hi> and partly in the

And thus they continued ≈øending during ≈øome weekes, in forme of pacquets or blancs with in≈øcription to any whom≈øoeuer who≈øe name they knew. One thing was much wondred at, that in the vulgar <hi>Copie</hi> printed in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> this clau≈øe of the impri≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the

            <p>The <hi>Monitorie</hi> was addre≈ø≈øed to the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches, Archbi≈øhops, Bi≈øhops,</hi> their <hi>Vicars Generall,</hi> and to all the

<hi>Ecclefia≈øticall,</hi> in briefe of <hi>Ecclefia≈øticall</hi> liberty, all of them tending to the danger of the ≈øoules both of the <hi>Duke</hi> and of all the <hi>Senators,</hi> and al≈øo to the great ≈øcandall of many others. That they which had made the≈øe Lawes had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred the Cen≈øures &amp; the confi≈øcation of their fiefs, from which they could not be ab≈øolued but by the <hi>Pope,</hi> and by reuoking fir≈øt all the≈øe ≈øtatutes and ordinances, and by re≈øtoring all things into the former e≈øtate.

               <hi>D'Alincourt, Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> of the mo≈øt <hi>Chri≈øtian King,</hi> did the ≈øame Office, but as from him≈øelfe; to who≈øe demands the <hi>Pope</hi> would not conde≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, but an≈øwered, that he ought rather to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the <hi>Republique</hi> to obey: wherefore he gaue adui≈øe to the
<hi>King</hi> his <hi>Ma≈øter</hi> by the ordinary <hi>Currier,</hi> as well of that which had pa≈ø≈øed, as al≈øo of the Office by him tendered, and of the <hi>Popes</hi> an≈øwer. The <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Verr√ºe, Amba≈ø≈øadour</hi> of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> treated with more vigour in the name of his <hi>Ma≈øter</hi> with his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting him to make delay, and to find meanes to compo≈øe the≈øe differences: to whom he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17285:49"/> that this were the ready way to render the
<hi>Venetian,</hi> more ob≈øtinate, and that the <hi>Duke</hi> ought to addre≈ø≈øe him≈øelfe to them, to make them obey. Whereupon the
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øadour</hi> could not containe him≈øelfe, but replied, that the word <hi>(Obey)</hi> was too har≈øh to be v≈øed towards a Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
<hi>Prince,</hi> and that a delay in this ca≈øe would in the end be found very behouefull. The great <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Tu≈øcany</hi> al≈øo writ to the
<hi>Bi≈øhop</hi> of <hi>Soana,</hi> praying him to doe the ≈øame Office in his name with his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the publication of the <hi>Monitory,</hi> the
<hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈ø≈øadors</hi> of the <hi>Republique</hi> were vi≈øited by the
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øadours</hi> of the <hi>Emperour,</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>France,</hi> and of the great <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Tu≈øcany;</hi> who communicated vnto them, what they had done with the <hi>Pope,</hi> and how they found him ≈øtill in his fir≈øt re≈øolution.</p>
            <p>Some men were of opinion, that the <hi>Pope,</hi> according to the cu≈øtome of tho≈øe that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out experience, quickly after the
<hi>Monitory</hi> had beene publi≈øhed, the heat of his courage being a little tempered, would ≈øeriou≈øly con≈øider the inconueniences which in all rea≈øon he might ≈øee would follow, and hereby beginning to relent, would de≈øire an occa≈øion to prolong the terme,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17285:50"/> if he were thereunto required by the
<hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</hi> Others ≈øaid, it was likely that by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of
<hi>Princes</hi> and their <hi>Amba≈ø≈øadors</hi> alone he would giue longer terme, if he did beleeue that the <hi>Republique</hi> would accept it. Which might haue beene for his aduantage, con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that by this meanes a way had beene ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to cau≈øe his commandements to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. But the
<hi>Pope</hi> remained firme, re≈øolued to ≈øee the i≈ø≈øue of his
<hi>Monitorie:</hi> the publication whereof being knowne at <hi>Venice,</hi> it was fir≈øt by the <hi>Senate</hi> ordered that all ≈øhould haue recour≈øe to their praiers, &amp; command was ≈øent to al <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Mona≈øteries</hi> as well of men as women, and other places of deuotion, to make ori≈øons and ≈øupplications, following the ancient v≈øage, and a good ≈øumme of money was al≈øo di≈øtributed in almes to the≈øe holy places. Then after they deliberated vpon the Gouernment, and con≈øul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted whether it were meet to leaue their <hi>Amba≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> or to call them home. Some were of opinion that they ≈øhould be recalled, ≈øince that the
<hi>Republique</hi> hauing receiued ≈øo great an iniury, could not with any honour keepe them at <hi>Rome.</hi> Others con≈øidered that to call them away were vtterly to breake off all communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:17285:50"/> In the end both opinions were appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and both the one and the other followed, with this temperament: They re≈øolued to call home onely the extraordinarie <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ≈øufficiently te≈øtifying their ≈øen≈øiblene≈ø≈øe of the wrong: but to leaue the Ordinary, to doe all offices of piety and reuerence towards the
<hi>See Apo≈øtolique,</hi> and to preuent an ab≈øolute rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which they would auoid till they were forced by an extreme violence. It was al≈øo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, to communicate all the≈øe matters to the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> to whom (till then) they had not imparted any of the≈øe things, for con≈øiderations which hinder to treat with him vpon points controuerted with the <hi>Pope.</hi> And accordingly they writ to <hi>Gregory Iu≈øtiniano Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈ø≈øador</hi> of the <hi>Repub.</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> that he ≈øhould informe the <hi>King. Henry Wotton</hi> the <hi>Engli≈øh Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> at <hi>Venice</hi> complained with words of courte≈øie that they had communicated the≈øe things to other <hi>Amba≈ø≈øadors</hi> ≈øo long before him: but for the preten≈øions of the <hi>Pope,</hi> he ≈øaid, that he could not vnder≈øtand this <hi>Romane Theologie</hi> which is contrary to all iu≈øtice and hone≈øty.</p>
            <p>Now to the end that they might prouide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the inconueniences which the <hi>Popes Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitorie</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:17285:51"/> might cau≈øe, command was giuen to all
<hi>Prelates</hi> and <hi>Ecclefiasticall</hi> per≈øons, that they ≈øhould not publi≈øh or permit to be publi≈øhed or affixed in any place where≈øoeuer, any <hi>Bulls, Breues,</hi> or other writings which might be ≈øent vnto them. Furthermore, proclamation was made, vnder paine of incurring the di≈øplea≈øure of the <hi>Prince,</hi> that who≈øoeuer had any
<hi>Copie</hi> of a certaine <hi>Breue</hi> publi≈øhed at <hi>Rome</hi> again≈øt the <hi>Republique,</hi> ≈øhould bring it vnto the
<hi>Magi≈øtrates</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> or to the Gouernours of Cities and other places of their <hi>State;</hi> to which all men did ≈øo cheerefully obey and brought out ≈øo many copies, that it was a thing maruellous to ≈øee what quantitie had beene imprinted; neither was any one any where affixed, by rea≈øon of the generall diligence of all the people, who di≈øcouered in diuers places and cau≈øed to arre≈øt tho≈øe who came for that effect. They imparted likewi≈øe to all the <hi>Agents</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi> which were then at <hi>Venice,</hi> the rea≈øons and cau≈øes of the≈øe motions; and the ≈øame was written to all the Re≈øidents for the <hi>Republique</hi> with
<hi>Princes.</hi> It was al≈øo thought fit by the <hi>Senate,</hi> to write to all Gouernours of Cities and places within their <hi>State,</hi> and to giue them aduice of the iniurie
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17285:51"/> which the <hi>Republique</hi> had receiued and did dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiue from the <hi>Pope;</hi> as al≈øo the pregnant rea≈øons which they had in their defence, with order that the≈øe letters ≈øhould be communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Con≈øuls</hi> &amp; Communalties of their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Which being done, euery where were ≈øeene the effects of an incredible obedience and ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion towards their <hi>Prince,</hi> with great re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to defend and maintaine the publique liberty, for aid whereof they offered ≈øuccour of men, of money and armes, according to the abilitie of each place: and the≈øe offers were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards performed, in their time, with the ≈øame promptitude and cheerefulne≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>During this time, <hi>Duodo</hi> the extraordinarie
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> of the <hi>Signiory</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> receiued commandement to depart. He tooke leaue of the <hi>Pope</hi> the 27. of the
<hi>Moneth,</hi> telling him, that ≈øeeing he could not obtaine of his
<hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> to take into his con≈øideration the rea≈øons by him repre≈øented, and hauing no more to ≈øay or doe, he was called backe to
<hi>Venice.</hi> The <hi>Pope</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered him with words of courte≈øie towards him≈øelfe, and touching the difference, ≈øaid, that he had done nothing but what his con≈øcience obliged him to doe; that the ca≈øe was cleare
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:17285:52"/> and decided; that in the whole order of his proceedings he had followed the example of his Predece≈ø≈øors: that his weapons in this quarrell were ≈øpirituall, the v≈øe whereof accorded well with that fatherly loue which he had euer ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the <hi>Republique,</hi> requiring onely ≈øuch obedience as all <hi>Princes</hi> are bound to render vnto him.</p>
            <p>But at <hi>Venice</hi> the <hi>Nuntio</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> after he had receiued aduice that the <hi>Monitorie</hi> was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhed, euery day frequented the hou≈øe of the <hi>Ie≈øuites,</hi> where were then
<hi>Fathers</hi> of great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie among≈øt them for their actions pa≈ø≈øed in the mo≈øt important affaires of <hi>State:</hi> among the re≈øt, were Father <hi>Bernardine Ca≈øtorius</hi> of <hi>Sie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> their
<hi>Superior,</hi> who was <hi>Prouinciall</hi> at <hi>Lyons</hi> at what time the <hi>Ie≈øuites</hi> were bani≈øhed thence: Father <hi>Anthony Po≈ø≈øeuine</hi> of great renowne for the things by him managed in
<hi>Mo≈øcouia</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia,</hi> not only whil≈øt he was in per≈øon in tho≈øe countries, but afterwards by his ≈øleights and treaties: Father
<hi>Iohn Baro</hi> a <hi>Venetian,</hi> a man greatly enterpri≈øing, not permitting that in any Citie where hee made his re≈øidence any thing ≈øhould pa≈ø≈øe of moment without his pre≈øence: Father <hi>Iohn Gentes</hi> much ver≈øed in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:17285:52"/> (as they call it) of Ca≈øes of Con≈øcience, apt to condemne and reprehend any action what≈øoeuer, if it were not done with their knowledge and coun≈øell, as al≈øo to u≈øtifie all the actions of their Obedients: be≈øides many other Fathers, all zealous practi≈øers of their fourth vow.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Nuntio</hi> hauing aduice of the <hi>Interdict,</hi> came not in <hi>Senate</hi> till the 28. of the ≈øame <hi>Moneth,</hi> where fir≈øt ≈øhewing a great di≈øplea≈øure for what was pa≈ø≈øed, he added that they ought not to proceed towards his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> with ≈øo much repugnance; that the <hi>Pope</hi> was moued by pure zeale; and that yet (if they would yeeld a little) all things might be accorded. And to this effect he de≈øired that his <hi>Serenitie</hi> would deui≈øe ≈øome temperament: that for his part he offred his interuention to repre≈øent it, and to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour it. But to the end that his di≈øcour≈øe might ≈øeeme more pa≈ø≈øionate, and be more per≈øwa≈øiue, the <hi>Nuntio</hi> ≈øea≈øoned it with many words of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and ≈øpake often of <hi>God,</hi> v≈øing the≈øe termes <hi>[our Lord,]</hi> of which al≈øo he ≈øerued him≈øelfe when he ≈øpake of the
<hi>Pope;</hi> which made his di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe ambiguous to the hearers, excepting ≈øome more prudent who had formerly ob≈øerued
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17285:53"/> in other actions, and at that time tooke notice, that in pronouncing the≈øe words <hi>[Our Lord]</hi> if he meant the
<hi>Pope</hi> he would vncouer his head, but when he ≈øpake it of
<hi>God,</hi> he held on his bonnet. To this di≈øcour≈øe mixt of affaires and ≈øimplicitie, made in forme of a <hi>Sermon,</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> an≈øwered: That none of found vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding could approue it, that a
<hi>Common-wealth</hi> ≈øo pious and Catholique ≈øhould be on ≈øuch a fa≈øhion vexed: that the actions of the <hi>Pope</hi> could not be iu≈øtified. He complained likewi≈øe that he had not deigned to heare their
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> Extraordinary: that he had publi≈øhed a
<hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitorie</hi> e≈øteemed vniu≈øt by euery one without any ≈øcruple, and that he came to ≈øo important a re≈øolution without knowing before how the world is gouerned; that his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> could not haue done an act more proper for to put the <hi>See Apo≈øtolique</hi> vpon the cen≈øure and hatred of all the world, and in a manife≈øt perill that if the
<hi>Republique</hi> ≈øhould hereupon ≈øeparate from the <hi>Pope,</hi> this ≈øeparation ≈øhould be followed with a lo≈ø≈øe irreparable to the
<hi>Eccle≈øiastiques.</hi> But that the <hi>Repub.</hi> would not depart from their piety, yet would defend them≈øelues; that for him, he did well to per≈øwade peace, but that he ≈øhould
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17285:53"/> turne his ≈øpeech to the <hi>Pope</hi> who troubled it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Nuntio</hi> hearing this, made ≈øome in≈øtance to haue an≈øwer likewi≈øe from the <hi>Senate,</hi> and tooke leaue. The
<hi>Senate</hi> eight daies afterward an≈øwered him in the ≈øame manner as the <hi>Duke</hi> had done: whith he vnder≈øtanding, beginning with the ≈øame vn≈øea≈øonable complaints, which at other times he had v≈øed, he pa≈ø≈øed further and made appeare his di≈øplea≈øure, in that he could not finde any temperament, concluding that the <hi>Senate</hi> ≈øhould take heed, le≈øt whiles they de≈øired to ≈øu≈øtaine a particular Law, they might draw on them≈øelues an vniuer≈øall ruine. To which the <hi>Duke</hi> an≈øwered, that he ought to ≈øpeake of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> who had v≈øed ≈øo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation, and that he ≈øhould doe well to ≈øet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes the imminent perils which might follow hereupon, with the nece≈ø≈øitie to auoid them by de≈øi≈øting from his iniuries; that the≈øe coun≈øells came from an old man many yeares imployed in the affaires of <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> knowing the <hi>Proclamation</hi> made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt his <hi>Monitory,</hi> &amp; the re≈øolution of the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of the
<hi>State,</hi> who were then mo≈øt ready to ≈øerue their <hi>Prince,</hi> &amp; to maintaine their Liberty, being therefore out of hope that his
<hi>Interdict</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:17285:54"/> would be ob≈øerued, he thought that his
<hi>Nuntio</hi> could not any longer continue at <hi>Venice,</hi> with his honour. And therfore he writ vnto him, ≈øpeedily to depart, &amp; the ≈øixt of <hi>May</hi> he ≈øent the <hi>Bi≈øhop</hi> of <hi>Soana</hi> to giue di≈ømi≈ø≈øion vnto <hi>Nani</hi> the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Re≈øident</hi> of the
<hi>Republique,</hi> charging him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øely not to leaue behind him at
<hi>Rome</hi> any one of his Company. Notwith≈øtading the <hi>Pope</hi> de≈øired to ≈øee him before his departure, and therefore the
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> hauing ≈øent to demand Audience the day following, he granted him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently. But after, either becau≈øe hee was ≈øo per≈øwaded by other, or of his owne motion, and peraduenture for feare le≈øt he ≈øhould make ≈øome Prote≈øtation, he ≈øent vnto him early in the morning the <hi>Ma≈øter of the Ceremonies,</hi> to tell him that he would not receiue him in quality of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈ø≈øadour,</hi> but that he might come as a priuate man, and ≈øo he would receiue and welcome him gladly. <hi>Nani</hi> made an≈øwer, that he knew not how he ≈øhould ≈øeparate from his Per≈øon the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador,</hi> and much le≈ø≈øe could he doe this without knowledge of his <hi>Prince,</hi> who≈øe Per≈øon he repre≈øented: and therefore ≈øince it would not plea≈øe his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> to ≈øee him as <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈ø≈øador,</hi> he was ready to be gone. The <hi>Master
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:17285:54"/> of the Ceremonies</hi> reported this an≈øwer to the <hi>Pope,</hi> who ≈øent him backe againe to <hi>Nani,</hi> with re≈øolution that he would not receiue him in qualitie of
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador.</hi> There were alreadie with him many <hi>Prelates</hi> and other per≈øons for to accompany him vnto the Audience; ≈øome whereof, hauing knowledge of the re≈øolution of his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe,</hi> and of the
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øadors</hi> purpo≈øe thereupon to depart, demanded of the
<hi>Ma≈øter</hi> of the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> whether they might accompany him, whereunto he an≈øwered as of him≈øelfe, that it ≈øeemed to him not conuenient: it fell out that all their Caroaches followed the
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador,</hi> but few <hi>Prelates</hi> accompanied him in Per≈øon. Yet ≈øome few went along with him, moued by ≈øome re≈øpects. But the
<hi>Count Iohn Francis de Gambara,</hi> although he was a <hi>Prelate</hi> of no great time, and by con≈øequent his hopes being ≈øo much the greater, as they were more fre≈øh, and who him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe had imployed the <hi>Pope</hi> for Interce≈ø≈øor to the <hi>Republique,</hi> for the deliuerance of the
<hi>Count Hannibal</hi> his brother from the Ban which hee had incurred, which yet hee was not able to obtaine, not without ≈øome indignation of his
<hi>Holine≈ø≈øe,</hi> yet did not omit to accompany the
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> in Per≈øon, ≈øaying that no occa≈øion
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17285:55"/> was ≈øufficient to make him forget his dutie; who≈øe action and words might iu≈øtly cau≈øe them to blu≈øh for ≈øhame, who being obliged by mo≈øt ≈øtrait bonds, were very forward to faile in their dutie. The <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> then departed Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably accompanied, for as much as the bruit of his departure being ≈øcattered thorow <hi>Rome,</hi> all they of the Nation re≈øorted to him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides the <hi>Barons</hi> and <hi>Romane</hi> Gentlemen affected to the <hi>Republique.</hi> But the
<hi>Pope</hi> on the morrow di≈øpatched after him a <hi>Colonell</hi> to accompany him thorow-out the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> who ouertooke him at <hi>Foligno,</hi> and offered to attend him, in the name of his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe.</hi> The <hi>Amba≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi> though he was well accompanied, receiued notwith≈øtanding the <hi>Colonell,</hi> for a part of the way, and then thanking his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe,</hi> ≈øent him backe, (who returned,) and was well entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in all places of the <hi>State Eccle≈øia≈øticall</hi> as he pa≈ø≈øed.</p>
            <p>At the ≈øame time, the chiefe of the <hi>Councell</hi> of Ten ≈øent for the <hi>Superiours</hi> of <hi>Mona≈øteries,</hi> and other
<hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Venice;</hi> to whom was made knowne that the intention of the <hi>Prince</hi> was that they ≈øhould continue the Diuine
<hi>Seruices,</hi> and that none of them ≈øhould depart out of the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17285:55"/> 
               <hi>State</hi> without permi≈ø≈øion; Protection was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øed to them that would remain, and for them that would be gone it was declared that they might not carry away any goods of the
<hi>Church,</hi> nor any other thing of value. They were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commanded, that if any <hi>Breue</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> or any order from their
<hi>Superiours</hi> were by any meanes ≈øent vnto them, they ≈øhould bring it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Magi≈øtrate</hi> before they reade it. In like manner the
<hi>Gouernours</hi> of all Cities within the <hi>State</hi> were commanded to doe the like thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all places of their Iuri≈ødiction. After they con≈øulted whether it were meet to make an≈øwer vnto the <hi>Monitory.</hi> There were that propo≈øed, to v≈øe the remedy of Appeale practi≈øed in all times by all <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Republiques,</hi> e≈øpecially within the≈øe la≈øt three hundred yeares, again≈øt the attempts of <hi>Popes,</hi> and particularly by the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> vpon like occa≈øions, and in like occurrences, yea euen ≈øince that the <hi>Popes, Pius</hi> 2. <hi>Sixtus</hi> 4. and <hi>Iulius</hi> 2. by their

Others neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe alledging that Appeales are made in ca≈øe of an iniu≈øtice, which hath ≈øome colour of iu≈øtice, which hath no place in this <hi>Monitory,</hi> where the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17285:56"/> nullities were in great numbers, and ≈øo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, their adui≈øe was receiued. Wherefore it was re≈øolued with one con≈øent, to write vnto the <hi>Prelates</hi> of the <hi>State,</hi> touching the iudgement of the <hi>Prince,</hi> concerning the <hi>Monitory</hi> publi≈øhed, and why he determined to v≈øe no other remedy. The≈øe Letters were written the ≈øixt of <hi>May,</hi> and were imprinted to be affixed in publique places, and contained in ≈øub≈øtance; that he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued adui≈øe of a Publication made at <hi>Rome</hi> on the ≈øeuenteenth of <hi>Aprill,</hi> of a certaine <hi>Breue</hi> ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated again≈øt him, and again≈øt the
<hi>Senate</hi> and <hi>Signory;</hi> wherefore being obliged to haue a care of the publique tranquillitie, and of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of a <hi>Soueraigne Prince,</hi> he Prote≈øted before <hi>God</hi> and all the world, that he had not omitted or neglected any meanes po≈ø≈øible to make the <hi>Pope</hi> capable of the mo≈øt cleare and ≈øtrong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons in behalfe of the
<hi>Republique.</hi> But hauing found his cares ≈øhut, and ≈øeene that
<hi>Breue</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhed again≈øt rea≈øon and iu≈øtice, and again≈øt the doctrine of the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and of the
<hi>Canons,</hi> in preiudice of the <hi>Secular</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie giuen by
<hi>God,</hi> and of the libertie of the <hi>State,</hi> with the trouble of the repo≈øe of his ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and to the great ≈øcandall of all the world;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17285:56"/> he did not doubt to account that <hi>Breue</hi> not onely for vniu≈øt, but for meerely void and null, and ≈øo vnlawfull that he did not repute it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to haue recour≈øe to ≈øuch remedies as in other occa≈øions the <hi>Republique</hi> and many <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Princes</hi> haue v≈øed again≈øt ≈øuch <hi>Popes</hi> as outpa≈ø≈øed the power to them giuen by <hi>God;</hi> tru≈øting, that the <hi>Prelates</hi> would hold on in their accu≈øtomed cour≈øes, and continue the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ≈øeruice, the
<hi>Republique</hi> being re≈øolued to per≈øeuere in the holy
<hi>Catholique</hi> faith, and in the reuerence of the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> ≈øuch as they had from the beginning euer tendered.</p>
            <p>Vpon this there hapned a thing notable: Vpon the 8. of <hi>May</hi> the ≈øame time that the <hi>Nuntio</hi> was with the <hi>Prince</hi> to demand leaue to be gone, were affixed thorowout the Citie Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the fore≈øaid letters, and as he returned he ≈øaw one fa≈øtned to the doore of <hi>S. Francis Church</hi> which was hard by his lodging.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Capuchins</hi> and <hi>Theatins</hi> vntill then did not thinke of departing out of the <hi>State,</hi> or at the lea≈øt they did not di≈øcouer their de≈øigne; on the contrary, the <hi>Prouinciall</hi> and other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the <hi>Capucines</hi> (which gouerned one of their
<hi>Prouinces</hi> which they haue within the

               <hi>State)</hi> when they vnder≈øtood that the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Monitorie</hi> was made at <hi>Rome,</hi> tooke coun≈øell among them≈øelues, and determined that, ≈øeeing no matter of faith was treated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Republique,</hi> they were not obliged to follow the intentions of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and to this effect (following this re≈øoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) they ≈øent letters to all their
<hi>Conuents</hi> ≈øituate within the <hi>State.</hi> Afterwards, receiuing an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øe command from their <hi>Superiors</hi> that by all meanes they ≈øhould be gone and retire out of the <hi>Venetian Dominions,</hi> they wrought in ≈øuch ≈øort that they were prohibited to depart vpon paine of death, and procured this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to be generall, to the end that they might be le≈ø≈øe ≈øu≈øpected: which being done, they rai≈øed and ≈øpred a rumour, that they had an intention to retire, but now they could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forbidden by the <hi>Prince</hi> vnder paine of death. But afterward they vtterly changed their opinion vpon the occa≈øion which followes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ie≈øuites,</hi> immediatly after they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that the
<hi>Monitorie</hi> had beene publi≈øhed in <hi>Rome,</hi> di≈øpatched to his
<hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> the Father <hi>Achilles Gaillardi</hi> of <hi>Padua</hi> for to repre≈øent vnto him what good offices they might doe to his
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:17285:57"/> aduantage if they were permitted to remaine within the <hi>State.</hi> For this rea≈øon, expecting here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of an an≈øwer from <hi>Rome,</hi> when the plea≈øure of the <hi>Senate</hi> was ≈øignified vnto them, they ≈øpake in apparence as did others: neuerthele≈ø≈øe either becau≈øe they were in doubt of the <hi>Popes</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or for ≈øome other rea≈øon, ≈øeruing them≈øelues of their ordinary equiuocations, they profe≈ø≈øed that they might continue the Diuine Offices, their Sermons &amp; Confe≈ø≈øions, according to their cu≈øtome. But the <hi>Pope</hi> hearing the propo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Ie≈øuites,</hi> and con≈øidering that if they did not publikely keepe the <hi>Interdict,</hi> they would bring more damage to his preten≈øions then profit by their ≈øleights which they could practi≈øe vnder hand, hee gaue them to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand that his re≈øolution was they ≈øhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerue the <hi>Interdict;</hi> and for this effect ≈øent vnto them a commandement by the ≈øame <hi>Currier</hi> which brought vnto the
<hi>Nuntio</hi> his order to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, yet that they might delay ≈øo long as they could with conuenience. Notwith≈øtanding they ≈øcattered a report that they had decreed to ≈øtay, ab≈øtaining only from ≈øaying <hi>Ma≈ø≈øe</hi> in publique, but otherwi≈øe to continue all Diuine Offices. And fora≈ømuch as it ≈øeemed a great diminution
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17285:58"/> of their reputation, if when they went away, the
<hi>Capuchines</hi> ≈øhould abide; after they had v≈øed many artifices to make them depart, as well by meanes of the <hi>Nuntio</hi> as of another Mini≈øter of a certaine <hi>Prince,</hi> who for foure daies ≈øpace han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their <hi>Couent</hi> at la≈øt they gained them, by ≈øug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øting, that all the world would ca≈øt their eyes vpon the <hi>Capuchines,</hi> and that their re≈øolution would be a definitiue ≈øentence of the validitie or inualiditie of the <hi>Monitorie.</hi> Wherefore ≈øince their opinion would be infallibly followed and embraced by all the world, they now had a faire occa≈øion offered to merit much of the <hi>Holy See.</hi> Which did puffe them vp in ≈øuch ≈øort, that they went to the <hi>Prince,</hi> to declare vnto him that they could not remaine, and Father <hi>Theodore de Bergama≈øco,</hi> the Companion of the <hi>Prouinciall,</hi> pa≈ø≈øed ≈øo far as that he had the boldne≈ø≈øe to ≈øay that their condition was much differing from the condition of the other <hi>Religious,</hi> who≈øe actions were of ≈ømall importance: but the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchins</hi> ought to be the rule of all the re≈øt, all the world hauing an eye to them for to take exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whether to e≈øteeme the <hi>Popes</hi> Cen≈øures or to contemne them.</p>
            <p>Now the terme of 24. daies prefixed in the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:17285:58"/> 
               <hi>Monitorie</hi> approaching, the
<hi>Ie≈øuites</hi> were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the 9. of <hi>May</hi> to giue a certaine re≈øoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; who then declared their equiuocation, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øing to ≈øay
<hi>Ma≈ø≈øe,</hi> which they ≈øaid was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their former promi≈øe, ina≈ømuch as the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øe,</hi> for the excellencie of it, is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>prehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnder the name of Diuine Offices. And certes it was a pretty inuention, to offer them≈øelues to doe Diuine Seruices, and then after to exclude the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øe</hi> becau≈øe of its excellence, and all others likewi≈øe becau≈øe they had not wont to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate them, and ≈øo by this ≈øhift to promi≈øe all things and performe nothing to the
<hi>Republique;</hi> as al≈øo to abide within the <hi>State,</hi> and yet withall to keepe the <hi>Interdict</hi> according to the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the
<hi>Pope.</hi> Hereupon the ≈øame day the point was put in con≈øultation, and it was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in full <hi>Senate</hi> to ≈øend the <hi>Grand Vicar</hi> of the <hi>Patriarke</hi> for to receiue and take into his charge all the ornaments and iewels of the <hi>Church,</hi> with commandement vnto the
<hi>Ie≈øuites</hi> that they ≈øhould ≈øpeedily auoid the Countrey. Letters al≈øo were written to the Gouernours of Cities, that they ≈øhould cau≈øe them to depart from the places of their Iuri≈ødiction. The
<hi>Ie≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> vnder≈øtanding this re≈øolution, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:17285:59"/> tumultuou≈øly vnto the <hi>Church</hi> their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoted ones, from whom they drew a very great ≈øumme of money; and per≈øwaded the <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines,</hi> that at their parting, they ≈øhould goe forth in Proce≈ø≈øion with the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> ≈øeditiou≈øly intending to moue the people, if it had been po≈ø≈øible. And the euening being come, they demanded of the <hi>Magi≈øtrates</hi> to be a≈ø≈øi≈øted by publique Officers for their ≈øecuritie, which was accorded vnto them. But here with not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting them≈øelues, they ≈øent to reque≈øt the
<hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈ø≈øador</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> that it would plea≈øe him to let them be attended by his Seruants, which he did not thinke fit, ≈øeeing they had already a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like guard.

All the next day there remained the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes of a fire in two places where they had bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned an incredible quantitie of writings. They left al≈øo a good number of cru≈øes to melt met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, the noi≈øe whereof being heard thorow the Citie, which ≈øcandalized the few deuoted ones which were left there, the <hi>Father Po≈ø≈øeuine</hi> writ (and his letter was publikely ≈øeene) that the≈øe cru≈øes were not to melt gold or ≈øiluer, as they were ≈ølandred, but only for to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>modate their bonnets. Shortly, there remained not any thing of importance within the <hi>Hou≈øe,</hi> ≈øaue the <hi>Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> bequeathed vnto them by the <hi>Arch-Bi≈øhop Leuys Molino Bi≈øhop</hi> of

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17285:60"/> to take heed how men pre≈ø≈øe or inculcate too much the grace of <hi>God:</hi> and in the third it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that men mu≈øt beleeue the <hi>Hierarchicall Church,</hi> although it tell vs that that is blacke, which our eye iudgeth to be white.

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Ie≈øuites</hi> being thus gone, there ≈øeemed ≈ømall cau≈øe of feare for the other <hi>Religious</hi> that they would breed any trouble. But vpon the bruit which ran of the <hi>Capuchines</hi> and

Others more adui≈øed, ≈øeeing well that this did proceed from their ambition to ≈øeem better than others, with de≈øigne to be fauoured by his
<hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈ø≈øe,</hi> dete≈øted their hypocri≈øie. But the <hi>Senate</hi> reputing it not agreeable to that rea≈øon and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice which they v≈øed in matters of <hi>State,</hi> nor to the ≈øeruice of <hi>God</hi> and tranquillitie of Religion; and that on the contrary in times ≈øo calamitous, ≈øuch a noueltie might bring much danger, if
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:17285:60"/> within the <hi>State</hi> it were permitted that any <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle≈øia≈øtique</hi> ≈øhould ob≈øerue the <hi>Iuterdict,</hi> gaue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that all tho≈øe who were not di≈øpo≈øed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Diuine Seruices ≈øhould retire out of their Dominions. Whereupon the <hi>Capuchines, Theatines,</hi> and the reformed <hi>Franci≈øcanes</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from
<hi>Venice,</hi> and others <hi>Religious</hi> were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the Gouernment of their <hi>Churches.</hi> But the <hi>Capuchines</hi> in the Territories of <hi>Bre≈øcia</hi> and <hi>Bergamo,</hi> where there were no
<hi>Ie≈øuites</hi> to ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them, did not accord with the other, but remained and continued their <hi>Diuine Seruices</hi> without any innouation, for which they were bitterly per≈øecuted by their <hi>Superiours</hi> at
<hi>Rome</hi> with Excommunications and other Spirituall penalties, although without effect as touching their Temporalls, becau≈øe the <hi>Prince</hi> had taken them into his protection: and for the Spirituals, they defended them≈øelues by ≈øome Writings which were publi≈øhed, vpon very good grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ds, being men well learned and of great prudence, who were not carried to take any re≈øolution but with the ≈øafety of their con≈øciences. The
<hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> according to the intention of the
<hi>Ie≈øuites,</hi> would haue gone out with ≈øolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, thereby to moue a tumult; but being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17285:61"/> hindered, they celebrated that morning only one
<hi>Ma≈ø≈øe,</hi> and con≈øumed all the holy <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the
<hi>Euchari≈øt,</hi> which was pre≈øerued in their <hi>Church,</hi> and concluded the <hi>Ma≈ø≈øe</hi> without giuing Benediction vnto the people. They left al≈øo to their <hi>Deuotes</hi> diuers in≈øtructions for to ob≈øerue the <hi>Interdict,</hi> as did likewi≈øe the <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</hi> But in ≈øuch a confu≈øion, and in ≈øo great ha≈øte, being not able to con≈øult together, they did not well accord with the <hi>Ie≈øuites,</hi> as al≈øo the <hi>Ie≈øuites</hi> di≈øagreed among≈øt them≈øelues; whence it came to pa≈ø≈øe that their adherents proceeded diuer≈øly, ≈øome being of opinion that all the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi> admini≈øtred by the
<hi>Prie≈øts</hi> that ≈øtayed were nullities, and therefore that it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to adore the holy <hi>Euchari≈øt,</hi> as before: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers e≈øteemed that to heare <hi>Ma≈ø≈øe</hi> was only a veniall ≈øinne, and others held it a ≈øin mo≈øt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, although the <hi>Sacrament</hi> were truely cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated. Of the≈øe in≈øtructions, and of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent wayes of ob≈øeruing them are yet to bee ≈øeene the Writings publi≈øhed by their Fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ie≈øuites</hi> being departed, retired them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues to
<hi>Ferrara, Bologna,</hi> and <hi>Mantua,</hi> neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring places, where they might receiue the

The other <hi>Religious</hi> likewi≈øe which were gone, retired in like maner to <hi>Milan, Ferrara,</hi> &amp; <hi>Bologne,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> where they were ≈øeene with an euill eye by the other
<hi>Religious</hi> of the ≈øame Orders, as tho≈øe who were come to ≈øpend part of their commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities. And the <hi>Superiours</hi> of Hou≈øes complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that though by this meanes the mouthes were doubled, yet the
<hi>Pope</hi> had not ≈øent any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proui≈øion but <hi>Indulgences;</hi> and they ≈øaid openly, that if other ≈øuccour did not come from
<hi>Rome,</hi> they could not continue to make ≈øuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, nor to furni≈øh ≈øo many per≈øons with Ve≈øtiments. And it is certaine that the
<hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchines,</hi> which departed out of the <hi>State</hi> of
<hi>Venice</hi> to the number of eight hundred, could not finde (at lea≈øt all of them) any conuenient retrait, ≈øo as many of them died for want of ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtenance.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Venice</hi> they communicated to all
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> and <hi>Agents</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> all that had pa≈ø≈øed, and al≈øo writ vnto the <hi>Mini≈øters</hi> of the
<hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> in all <hi>Courts;</hi> how that the <hi>Nuntio</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:17285:62"/> that their <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> had been di≈ømi≈ø≈øed; that the <hi>Republique</hi> iudged all things done here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by the <hi>Pope,</hi> meere nullities; that they were re≈øolued to liue
<hi>Catholiques,</hi> and to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Rome</hi> men held for con≈øtant that the
<hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitorie</hi> would cau≈øe three notable effects. The fir≈øt, that the
<hi>Religious</hi> would all depart the Countrey, and ≈øo the
<hi>Interdict</hi> at lea≈øt by nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitie ≈øhould be ob≈øerued. The ≈øecond, that the Cities and people ≈øeeing them≈øelues depriued of Diuine Offices &amp; Exerci≈øes would ≈øeditiou≈øly be moued and ≈øend to the
<hi>Prince</hi> to giue ≈øatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe.</hi> The third that vpon this occa≈øion the <hi>Nobilitie</hi> might be di≈øordered, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and terrified, &amp; ≈øo diuided among≈øt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues. Vpon the≈øe hopes and con≈øiderations they ≈øuffered to ≈ølip not onely the foure and twenty daies before determined, but many more; during which the
<hi>Ie≈øuites,</hi> tho ab≈øent, put in worke all their artifices. But they ≈øaw at <hi>Rome,</hi> that neither the <hi>Cen≈øures</hi> nor the ≈øleights of the <hi>Ie≈øuites</hi> did worke any great effect, nor produced the commotions which they had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured; ≈øo that (except the <hi>Ie≈øuites</hi> bani≈øhed, the <hi>Capuchines</hi> and <hi>Theatines</hi> di≈ømi≈ø≈øed) no other
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:17285:62"/> Order was departed, and the Diuine Seruice was celebrated after the cu≈øtome, yea oftentimes with more ≈øolemnitie, the people comming to the <hi>Churches</hi> in greater multitudes, and ≈øome of them now frequented the <hi>Seruice,</hi> which at other times had not beene ≈øo diligent. The <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> was greatly vnited in their deliberations, the Citie of <hi>Venice</hi> and the inhabitants kept them≈øelues in all quiet obedience, and the Cities of the <hi>E≈øtate</hi> which till then had not ≈øent their Deputies to the new <hi>Duke</hi> for congratulation, did now performe that duty, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard or re≈øpect vnto the

And this ≈øo great a tranquillitie did not onely proceed from the voluntarie obedience of the people, but al≈øo from the prouidence of the
<hi>Senate,</hi> and the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the <hi>Magi≈øtrates</hi> which prouided for all accidents: and this great affaire was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted with ≈øo much prudence and dexteritie, that no bloud of any man was ≈øhed for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or rebellion; euery man admiring that ≈øo great a Body and Gouernment ≈øhould be kept vpright without any violence or execution. For

            <p>The <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> blamed the actions of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> and tho≈øe which ≈øpake lea≈øt to his di≈øad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, ≈øaid, that though his cau≈øe had beene neuer ≈øo iu≈øt, yet in his proceeding he had v≈øed too great celeritie, and too too exce≈ø≈øiue confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. On the other ≈øide they commended the prudence of the
<hi>Venetians,</hi> who hauing receiued ≈øo vehement a ≈øhocke had yet retained their ≈øtate in repo≈øe and tranquillitie. After this came to
<hi>Rome</hi> the Father <hi>Antony Bari≈øon,</hi> who had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken po≈øte to goe tell the <hi>Pope</hi> what was ≈øaid at <hi>Ferrara</hi> (from whence he came,) and at other places confining vpon the <hi>State</hi> of

<hi>Pontificall</hi> dignity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> made great complaints in the
<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtorie</hi> that the <hi>Interdict</hi> was not ob≈øerued by the

Neuerthele≈ø≈øe the <hi>Cardinals</hi> did not beleeue that as well the <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øtiques</hi> as the people for the mo≈øt part were per≈øwaded that the <hi>Cen≈øures</hi> were nullities; rather they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that there was in them a di≈øpo≈øition to ob≈øerue them, but that they expected ≈øome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion to come to that effect; wherefore they e≈øteemed it good to giue occa≈øion by exciting the <hi>Religious</hi> to ≈øome new practi≈øes, either by ab≈øtaining from Diuine Offices, or by departing out of the <hi>State.</hi> This was the rea≈øon, why the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> Protectors of the <hi>Regulars,</hi> together with their <hi>Superiors</hi> which were in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in other places of
<hi>Italie,</hi> did what they could with them, with menaces of Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures, paines, and other euils corporall and ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, as al≈øo with promi≈øes of graces, honours, dignities, not only to the Chiefe but further to each particular, if they would ob≈øerue the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict</hi> or retire them≈øelues.</p>
            <p>But they dealt one way with the <hi>Monks</hi> and other

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:17285:64"/> depart; that it was the intention of <hi>Our Lord</hi> (≈øo they called the <hi>Pope,)</hi> and if they could not depart, that they ≈øhould in this cau≈øe ≈øuffer mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome. But to the rented and endowed they gaue to vnder≈øtand that the <hi>Pope</hi> though hee would haue the <hi>Interdict</hi> ob≈øerued, yet hee would not therefore haue the
<hi>Mona≈øteries</hi> aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. They ≈øent al≈øo as

Further, they ≈øuborned ≈øome hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites or <hi>Hermites,</hi> to enter within the Countrey to excite ≈øome troubles among the people, but being found vpon the confines loaden with papers and in≈øtructions, they were ≈øent backe, vpon a commandement giuen by the <hi>Senate</hi> the 24. of <hi>May</hi> to all
<hi>Gouernours</hi> to take heed that no <hi>Religious</hi> or

            <p>The end of this <hi>Inbilee</hi> was very well knowne in

He made further a Li≈øt of Captaines fit to ≈øerue him when he had need, which Li≈øt he euery where diuul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and called to his ≈øeruice ≈øome of tho≈øe that were in <hi>Flanders.</hi> He forbade likewi≈øe them of <hi>Romagna,</hi> and the

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:17285:92"/> The <hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> added ≈øome twenty Companies of the ba≈øer <hi>Spani≈øh,</hi> making in all 1800. men, the greater part being young, raw, and without any experience in the wars, which were put in the Garri≈øons. He made al≈øo ≈øome mu≈øters of Hor≈øe-men within their quarters, that they might not be payed, who appeared on hor≈øes for the mo≈øt part borrowed, being not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to furni≈øh them≈øelues with hor≈øes, vnle≈ø≈øe they had receiued their pay.

<hi>Cardinall Borromeo,</hi> for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this Grant, did contradict it, ≈øaying, that the charge was new, and had neuer beene impo≈øed. Wherefore they re≈øolued humbly to intreat his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe,</hi> and the <hi>Count de Fuentes,</hi> that ≈øuch a nouelty might not be introduced.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:17285:93"/> The <hi>Count</hi> was not earne≈øt in the affaire, and therefore it ea≈øily pa≈ø≈øed without execution. He made al≈øo a rumor to be ≈øcattered that he would haue an armie in readine≈ø≈øe of fiue and twenty thou≈øand men, compo≈øed of <hi>Neapolitans, Dutch, Sui≈ø≈øes</hi> and <hi>Spaniards;</hi> but becau≈øe he began not to execute this De≈øigne till the yeare following, we ≈øhall ≈øpeake more thereof in due place.

            <p>But the <hi>Senate</hi> at <hi>Venice</hi> did not ≈øo much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Preparations of the <hi>Pope,</hi> as to preuent ≈øome ambu≈øhes, and the army at Sea prouided at <hi>Naples.</hi> Therefore be≈øides the eight and twenty Gallies which they had ordinarily, they adioined other ten; and three great Gallies with twentie le≈ø≈øer Barques, whereof each one carried fifty Souldiers.

<hi>Candie,</hi> that he ≈øhould ≈øend to <hi>Corfu</hi> the Gallies appointed for the guard of that <hi>I≈øle,</hi> well ≈øtrengthned. They commanded all the Sea-Captaines to retaine all Ve≈ø≈øels, which pa≈ø≈øed by the <hi>Gulfe,</hi> for what place ≈øoeuer, and to ≈øend them vnto
<hi>Venice,</hi> except ≈øuch as had Patents from the <hi>K.</hi> of

<hi>Romagna,</hi> and the <hi>Marqui≈øate</hi> of <hi>Ancona,</hi> which by this meanes were in a manner be≈øieged. All exportation of Corne was prohibited, euen vnto Subiects <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle≈øia≈øticall;</hi> and the tran≈øportation of Gold and Siluer aboue ten Ducates, into the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> &amp; the Reuenues of ≈øuch

The le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uies of men which had beene made out of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, were di≈øcharged to a third part, to the end that al heads of Families, and men maried ≈øhould be left behind, and that third amounted to the number of twelue thou≈øand foot-men. Be≈øides the Garri≈øons which were ordinarily kept in the Forts, they leuyed in the beginning two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand

            <p>The <hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> for to maintaine the effect of the promi≈øe of his <hi>King</hi> and of his ≈øleights, gaue the <hi>Pope</hi> often to vnder≈øtand, ≈øometime by meanes of the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> of his Ma≈øter at <hi>Rome,</hi> ≈øometime by expre≈ø≈øe per≈øons, what he purpo≈øed to doe, and how he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolued to hinder the pa≈ø≈øage of any ≈øouldiers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Italy,</hi> giuing adui≈øe that hee kept a ≈øtrong guard on the confines of the <hi>Gri≈øons</hi> to that end, and that he was armed in the frontiers of <hi>Venice</hi> to keepe them in awe. All this notwith
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:17285:95"/> ≈øtanding, the <hi>Pope</hi> knew well that by rea≈øon of the dearth and famine which was in <hi>Naples,</hi> the Proui≈øions out of that <hi>Kingdome</hi> would goe on but ≈ølowly, and further he ≈øaw that hee could not ≈øatisfie the demands which were made on the behalfe of <hi>Spaine.</hi> Be≈øides he thought deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the words which that <hi>King</hi> had ≈øpoken to his <hi>Nuntio,</hi> that his purpo≈øe was not to moue any warre, but onely to a≈ø≈øi≈øt the
<hi>Pope</hi> if he were a≈ø≈øaulted in his owne <hi>State;</hi> for which cau≈øe he imagined that the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> did rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire to ≈øee Him lo≈øe reputation, and the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> driuen to expences, then that the affaire ≈øhould be ended to his aduantage. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee lent an eare to all that ≈øpake of the accord, and e≈øpecially becau≈øe it was ardently de≈øired by his Brethren, who had a purpo≈øe to buy
<hi>Regnano</hi> of <hi>Lucio Sauelli,</hi> as afterward they did, notwith≈øtanding the need which the <hi>See Apo≈øtolique</hi> had of money. For the≈øe con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations the <hi>Pope</hi> heard and fauoured greatly the
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> of the mo≈øt <hi>Chri≈øtian King,</hi> who ≈øpake vnto him touching the accord; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> of
<hi>Spaine</hi> did the ≈øame offices for a Peace, his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> neuerthele≈ø≈øe hearkned more willingly to him of <hi>France,</hi> as
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:17285:95"/> well becau≈øe he iudged that the mo≈øt

            <p>But in <hi>Spaine</hi> the <hi>Coun≈øellors</hi> of <hi>State</hi> being come to <hi>Court,</hi> made reflexion vpon the <hi>Letter</hi> written by their <hi>King,</hi> and vpon the practi≈øes of the <hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> with the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie;</hi> and how it was not their intention to make Warre, but onely to ≈øhew that that Crowne on all occa≈øions would vnite with the <hi>See Apo≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</hi> Al≈øo they thought it nece≈ø≈øarie to let them of <hi>Venice</hi> vnder≈øtand ≈øo much, to the end that nothing might fall out again≈øt their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and repenting them≈øelues to haue ≈øuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the≈øe differences to run ≈øo far, they iudged it expedient for their affaires to interpo≈øe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues in ≈øome fa≈øhion. But being de≈øirous to effect the≈øe de≈øignes with ≈øome reputation, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lerma,</hi> when the
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> had imparted vnto him all that had pa≈ø≈øed in this affaire, ≈øaid, that in the maine of the≈øe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouer≈øies the <hi>Republique</hi> ≈øu≈øtained the right of all

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:17285:96"/> them≈øelues vnto the <hi>Catholique King,</hi> who would make knowne vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> what preiudice hee did vnto him≈øelfe by putting in hazard the obedience vnto him. He added, that the
<hi>King</hi> his Ma≈øter had commanded his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters to be in≈øtruments of Peace, and would haue continued, if he had not beene forced to doe the contrary, becau≈øe they had admitted the authoritie of ≈øome
<hi>Princes,</hi> who had not any intere≈øt in the affaires of <hi>Italy.</hi> Afterward, they endeuoured by the meanes of <hi>Count d'Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uares</hi> to per≈øwade the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> that he would make ≈øome in≈øtance vnto that <hi>King,</hi> if not in the name of the

And when the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> had refu≈øed to doe this without commi≈ø≈øion, they re≈øolued to deale openly; and to ≈øend <hi>Don Iuan de Vela≈øco, Con≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> of <hi>Ca≈øtile</hi> into <hi>Italy</hi> without certaine in≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but that they ≈øhould be ≈øent after him according to the occurrences.

               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:17285:96"/> he had much troubled the <hi>Cardinals</hi> in the point of precedencie. Wherefore they thought vpon <hi>Iohn Idiaques,</hi> and others, but to auoid delaies, it was ordained that <hi>D.

And then briefly recapitulating what had pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, he concluded, That it was not for them to open the way which had beene ≈øtopt vp by

<hi>Vicar</hi> of <hi>Ie≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> there is not any who is not obliged to obey him: That the <hi>King</hi> his Ma≈øter did not intend, that the Lawes of the <hi>Repub.</hi> (whereof was que≈øtion) ≈øhould be ≈øent vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> to the end that he might correct or amend them; or that they ≈øhould doe any thing contrary to their libertie, or preiudiciall to the dignitie of the <hi>Republique;</hi> That if the <hi>Senate</hi> had any intention to do ≈øuch a thing (as tending to the preiudice of all

The <hi>Duke</hi> hereunto an≈øwered, that the <hi>Republique</hi> had made appeare vnto the <hi>Pope</hi> all kinds of ≈øeruice and filiall reuerence, before
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:17285:98"/> that his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> came to the publication of his <hi>Cen≈øures,</hi> ≈øo as there remained no more to bee done; but the <hi>Monitorie</hi> being publi≈øhed, the <hi>Nuntio</hi> called away, and all communication interrupted, they could not now any longer do the ≈øame acts of re≈øpect, vnle≈ø≈øe the <hi>Pope</hi> by taking off his

To that the <hi>Duke</hi> an≈øwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that as formerly he had euer ≈øaid, ≈øo for the time to come he would ≈øay ≈øtill, it was nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to remoue the impediment. But that this ≈øhould be done by this meane or that, or by the free will of the <hi>Pope,</hi> or at the reque≈øt of ≈øome other, it little imported for the ≈øub≈øtance of the affaire; and that his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> might doe what plea≈øed him. The
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> an≈øwered; Your <hi>Serenitie</hi> may well be content, that the <hi>Pope</hi> be intreated in your Name. The <hi>Duke</hi> ≈øaid, That for the repo≈øe of <hi>Italy,</hi> and to hinder ≈øo many mi≈øchiefes as might follow vpon the warre if it were begun, if the
<hi>Catholique King</hi> were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that the <hi>Pope</hi> being moued on this fa≈øhion
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:17285:98"/> would remoue his Cen≈øures, he would not hold it any great inconuenience to be ≈øo contented; that yet notwith≈øtanding he would giue him a more re≈øolute an≈øwer with the <hi>Senate.</hi> Then the
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> taking him at the word, immediatly an≈øwered, that he receiued that word from his <hi>Serenity,</hi> which was to pray the
<hi>Pope,</hi> and euen in his Name, to take away the Cen≈øures; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to treat with him in words of courte≈øie, he thought it nece≈ø≈øary to adioyne, that his <hi>Serenity</hi> was ≈øory that he had giuen any di≈øgu≈øt vnto his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe;</hi> that ≈øuch like words of courte≈øie were vaine and nothing, but yet nece≈ø≈øary in this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence. The <hi>Duke</hi> replyed, that neither him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe nor the <hi>Senate</hi> had giuen any occa≈øion of di≈øgu≈øt vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> if he had taken any him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe without cau≈øe, they could not helpe it; that in voluntary di≈øcontents, there is no other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die than a voluntary acknowledgement.</p>
            <p>The ≈øame day the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> of <hi>France</hi> was at the Audience, where he reported, how the <hi>Pope</hi> had ≈øaid to
<hi>Moun≈øieur de Alincourt,</hi> that he had taken the voices of all the
<hi>Cardinals,</hi> which were found all conformable, and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their aduice he could not come to a ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øion of the Cen≈øures, if in behalfe of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:17285:99"/> there were not made ≈øome demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion. Then he added, that haply the <hi>Pope</hi> might ≈øuffer him≈øelfe to be per≈øwaded by rea≈øon, and be induced to begin the fir≈øt; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it was nece≈ø≈øary to tell him what the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pub.</hi> would doe afterwards, otherwi≈øe he would neuer be moued. And therefore that it behoued the <hi>Republique</hi> to declare what they would doe, and to re≈øt confidently on the <hi>King,</hi> who was their Friend and Confederate, and who tooke to heart the intere≈øts of the <hi>Republique;</hi> that they might ≈øafely open them≈øelues to him, and ought not to beleeue that his
<hi>King</hi> had any other end ≈øaue only the Weale of the <hi>Signiory.</hi> The <hi>Duke</hi> an≈øwered, that to this matter they had ≈øpoken al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ≈øufficiently, and their an≈øwer ≈øent vnto the <hi>King,</hi> both by him≈øelfe, and by the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador,</hi> which they had with his
<hi>Maie≈øtie;</hi> that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was not meet, ≈øeeing he could not yet haue receiued any an≈øwer to that which had bin written and ≈øaid vnto the
<hi>King. Moun≈øieur de Fre≈øne</hi> replyed, that he fore≈øaw what the
<hi>King</hi> would ≈øay, ≈øeeing that which they had written was only in generall termes; and that he was forced to preuent that which the <hi>King</hi> would ≈øay, being much pre≈ø≈øed on the ≈øide of <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:17285:99"/> where affaires were treated with great dignitie; that it was needful in ≈øome ≈øort to ≈øubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues, and that the Temporalty did not receiue any preiudice by yeelding to his
<hi>Holine≈ø≈øe,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>√† ius Commune,</hi> to humble ones ≈øelfe vnto the Soueraigne <hi>Bi≈øhops.</hi> And he adioyned, that he made this in≈øta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce, beleeuing that they ≈øhould doe great wrong vnto the
<hi>King,</hi> and to that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which he euer bare to the
<hi>Republique,</hi> not to be confident in him, and freely to open vnto him the heart. And therefore to gratifie the <hi>King</hi> that they ≈øhould make this declaration, ≈øeeing that by means of a ≈øimple promi≈øe made to his
<hi>Maie≈øty,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> would be content to ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the Cen≈øures. He put al≈øo in great con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration the Letter of the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> to the <hi>Pope,</hi> magnifying the promi≈øes of that <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Popes</hi> acknowledgement to him, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that it was no time therefore to di≈øgu≈øt the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who without doubt would take it very vnkindly if they ≈øhould not ≈øpeake plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and freely with him. To this la≈øt point the
<hi>Duke</hi> began to an≈øwer, telling him, that the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was not ≈øuch as it was publi≈øhed, nor the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes ≈øo great as men made them, and that the <hi>Pope</hi> him≈øelfe did not much tru≈øt vnto them
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:17285:100"/> That the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> of
<hi>Spaine</hi> euen then was come to treat with them in very milde termes, confe≈ø≈øing the Rea≈øons of the <hi>Republique</hi> to be ≈øuch, as that if they yeelded, all <hi>Princes</hi> ≈øhould thereby be much preiudiced; and that when the <hi>Republique</hi> ≈øhould doe any thing not fitting, or ≈øhould be wronged in their Authority, the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> ≈øhould equally partake in the damage, becau≈øe of the Intere≈øts common to all <hi>Princes,</hi> and that it was cleare and euident, that the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> applyed him≈øelfe to an accord; that it was not meet to precipitate the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting before what ≈øhould come after. Further he added, that what≈øoeuer were the euent, the
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi> would neuer degenerate from the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and con≈øtancy of their Ance≈øtors. Then <hi>Moun≈øieur de Fre≈øne</hi> prayed the
<hi>Duke</hi> not to take in euill part the words which he had ≈øaid, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a ≈øingular affection, and that only to ≈øignifie that the
<hi>Pope</hi> being a≈ø≈øured that no <hi>Cardinall</hi> would con≈øent to the Su≈øpen≈øion, if fir≈øt ≈øomething were not done at <hi>Venice,</hi> it was nece≈ø≈øary to adui≈øe what might be done, &amp; how farre they could yeeld, which being done, they might with all confidence communicate with his
<hi>King,</hi> as with their Friend. The <hi>Senate</hi> hauing
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:17285:100"/> con≈øidered the Propo≈øitions of the≈øe two
<hi>Amba≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øadors,</hi> made an≈øwer to him of <hi>Spaine,</hi> ≈øaying, That it was nece≈ø≈øary to apply the remedies to the part whence the euil proceeded; that in the≈øe Differences the <hi>Republique</hi> had not giuen any cau≈øe, and that all did ari≈øe only out of the <hi>Popes</hi> will, who had not only attempted to violate the Liberty of the <hi>Republique,</hi> and to take away their Power, but further had gone to offences and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries. Notwith≈øtanding ≈øince the <hi>King</hi> de≈øired to pacifie the≈øe Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tentions, to the end that they might proceed no further, it was meet that he ≈øhould turne to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and there helpe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the Peace by the reuocation of his iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And when the <hi>King</hi> ≈øhould haue certaine word that the <hi>Pope</hi> would take away his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures, the
<hi>Republique,</hi> for to gratifie his <hi>Maie≈øtie,</hi> would be content that by forme of Office he might pray the <hi>Pope</hi> in their Name to remoue them; and they yet adioyned, that the <hi>Senate</hi> with di≈øplea≈øure re≈øented that his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> had taken in euill part the Actions of a <hi>Republique</hi> ≈øo well deuoted to him, which had no other end but the glory of <hi>God,</hi> the con≈øeruation of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique tranquillity, and of that Liberty &amp; Power which <hi>God</hi> had giuen them. This ≈øame an≈øwer
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:17285:101"/> was al≈øo made to the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and withall, that if the <hi>King</hi> did thinke good, he might ≈øerue him≈øelf of the ≈øame Forme towards the <hi>Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the fir≈øt word giuen to make ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the Negotiation, whereof when the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> ≈øaw there proceeded no good effect, but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ob≈øerued, that not only the <hi>Pope</hi> continued his preparations of War, but al≈øo made pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing in≈øtances with the
<hi>King Catholique,</hi> for the execution of his promi≈øes, that he di≈øpatched often into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and pur≈øued the De≈øignes of the
<hi>Count de Fuentes,</hi> to arme powerfully; they beleeued that the
<hi>Pope</hi> was farre from any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, although he ≈øhewed the contrary, or that po≈ø≈øibly he de≈øired to appeare pui≈ø≈øant, that he might treat with the more aduantage. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they e≈øteemed it nece≈ø≈øary to trie in like manner what would be the intention of their Friends, in ca≈øe they ≈øhould come to ≈øtrokes; and hereupon they writ to their
<hi>Amba≈ø≈ø.</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> for to giue adui≈øe vnto the <hi>Princes</hi> with whom they re≈øided, that the
<hi>Pope</hi> was eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day further from all rea≈øonable Pacification, and went on with his warlike Proui≈øions; that already the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>Spaine</hi> had declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:17285:101"/> hauing giuen his owne Letter for a pledge, with promi≈øe to a≈ø≈øi≈øt him: that the <hi>Pope</hi> ≈øent of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into
<hi>Spaine.</hi> On the other part, that the <hi>Repub.</hi> was re≈øolued to doe nothing again≈øt their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Honour for any re≈øpect; that the
<hi>Senate</hi> thought it time to haue recour≈øe vnto their
<hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties,</hi> to vnder≈øtand their intentions, and what they would be plea≈øed to doe, if things ≈øhould fall out into a manife≈øt rupture. The≈øe <hi>Amba≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> had al≈øo charge from the
<hi>Republique,</hi> to doe what they could to ≈øound the intention of the≈øe
<hi>Kings,</hi> and to draw from them ≈øome re≈øolution. Be≈øides, it was deliberated to call the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> of the one and the other
<hi>King,</hi> Re≈øidents at <hi>Venice,</hi> &amp; to impart vnto them the ≈øame things. Whereupon the <hi>Engli≈øh Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> (after he had thanked the <hi>Senate</hi> for this Communication, and had complained in the Name of the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Ma≈øter,</hi> of the iniuries which were offered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt all Rea≈øon, to a <hi>Republique</hi> which merited graces and fauours,) he prai≈øed their Genero≈øity and re≈øolution to defend their Honour, a≈ø≈øuring them that on ≈øo important an occa≈øion, they ≈øhould haue from his <hi>King</hi> all aid and fauour, as well in good Offices, as in Armes and ≈øuccours. The <hi>Amba≈ø≈øadour</hi> al≈øo propo≈øed, as from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:17285:102"/> a League with his <hi>King,</hi> and other
<hi>Princes</hi> his Friends.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> of <hi>France</hi> an≈øwered, that the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Ma≈øter</hi> acknowledged very well the Rea≈øons of the <hi>Republique,</hi> and the wrongs offered vnto them by the <hi>Pope;</hi> with whom not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding they ought not to proceed too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigorou≈øly, giuing example of the ≈øubmi≈ø≈øions which the <hi>King</hi> had v≈øed towards
<hi>Pope Clement,</hi> and exhorting the <hi>Republique</hi> to v≈øe all diligence to find ≈øome meanes to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>modate the≈øe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouer≈øies: adioyning neuerthele≈ø≈øe, that if they ≈øhould come to Armes, (which he could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue) the <hi>King</hi> would a≈ø≈øi≈øt the <hi>Signiory.</hi> That the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not in ca≈øe to beginne new Warres, that they brought nothing but words and apparences, which for certaine would not come to effects. But if that ≈øhould fall out, he promi≈øed in ample words the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of his <hi>King.</hi> He added further, that the <hi>Pope</hi> ≈øpake mildly, demanding that the Lawes might be ≈øu≈øpended, and that he would ≈øu≈øpend his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures; yea when≈øoeuer the <hi>Pope</hi> was a≈ø≈øured that the Lawes would be ≈øu≈øpended, he would be the fir≈øt to ≈øu≈øpend the Cen≈øures. Moreouer, <hi>Mounfieur de Fre≈øne</hi> propounded another mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:17285:102"/> yet as from him≈øelfe: that (for to put an end to all debate, and wholly to ≈øtay the <hi>Pope,</hi> with a≈ø≈øurance that the rea≈øons of the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> ≈øhould remaine entire,) they might remit all difficulties into the hands of the two <hi>Kings</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> who becau≈øe of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øts, and ≈øeeing the matter was common to all <hi>Princes,</hi> could not but approue the Lawes and actions of the <hi>Senate.</hi> Whereupon they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered the great difficulties which might grow before the <hi>Pope</hi> might be made to con≈øent to this ouerture, and after he had con≈øented, how many other que≈øtions might ari≈øe before the conclu≈øion. So it was repre≈øented to the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈ø≈øador,</hi> that this propo≈øition could not ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; wherefore he pa≈ø≈øed it in ≈øilence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Senate</hi> adui≈øed their <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> in
<hi>Spaine</hi> of all the≈øe propo≈øitions and an≈øwers, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him to thanke the <hi>Catholique King</hi> for his offer to interpo≈øe in this affaire, and to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon≈øtrance vnto him, how needfull it was for that
<hi>Crowne</hi> to con≈øerue the amitie of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique,</hi> and ≈øo mode≈øtly to complaine that the de≈øignes of the <hi>Pope</hi> were fomented by the <hi>Letters</hi> of his <hi>Maie≈øtie,</hi> and by the offices of ≈øome of his Mini≈øters.

<hi>King</hi> had written to the <hi>Pope,</hi> a≈ø≈øuring them with effectuall words, that it was nothing, and that it was written onely in generall termes, ≈øince the <hi>King</hi> his Ma≈øter had no intention to a≈ø≈øi≈øt the <hi>Pope,</hi> but onely in ca≈øe that he were ≈øet vpon in his owne <hi>E≈øtate,</hi> by the forces of the <hi>Republique,</hi> accompanied with the Armes of forraine <hi>Princes;</hi> but otherwi≈øe hee had not any purpo≈øe to offend the <hi>Republique.</hi> And although the

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:17285:103"/> to ≈øignifie they were ≈øorry for the di≈øgu≈øts of his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe.</hi> But that the commi≈ø≈øion which the <hi>Senate</hi> had giuen him for to pray the <hi>Pope,</hi> was too much re≈øtrained, to produce any good effect; that therefore it was meet to inlarge it, as might ≈øeeme good to his <hi>Serenitie.</hi> And hee added further, that he a≈ø≈øured the <hi>Republique</hi> on the word of a <hi>King,</hi> of this his good intention; and more, that hee knew not whether others, who made ≈øhew to interpo≈øe them≈øelues in this agreement, aimed ≈øo much at Peace, as the <hi>King</hi> his Ma≈øter. Some men beleeued that <hi>Cardenas</hi> re≈øolued to doe this office, after he vnder≈øtood the communication which had beene made to the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øadors</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and

<hi>Spaine</hi> they employed them≈øelues with all ≈øinceritie to the Pacification: and did what was po≈ø≈øible to per≈øwade the <hi>Nuntio</hi> to treat with the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> at lea≈øt in ≈øecret, to the end that from him hee might vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand that which they thought not conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for them≈øelues to tell him: Particularly the a≈ø≈øurance which the <hi>King</hi> gaue, that hee would not a≈ø≈øi≈øt the

            </p>
            <p>Although the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe of the agreement was in the hands of two great <hi>Kings,</hi> neuerthele≈ø≈øe the great <hi>Duke</hi> of

               <hi>Repub.</hi> in which hee had no other intere≈øt then that of amitie, his owne affaires being in good ca≈øe, and very well ≈øetled. That if there had beene any corre≈øpondence on the ≈øide of the <hi>Republique,</hi> by communicating vnto him their intentions, and giuing him ≈øome liberty to treat, hee had peraduenture brought the affaire to good termes; adding withall a large di≈øcour≈øe of the profit and aduantages of Concord, of the damages and incommodities of Warre. The <hi>Senate</hi> made an≈øwer to his <hi>Re≈øident,</hi> and gaue order to <hi>Robert Lio Secretary</hi> of the <hi>Signiorie,</hi> who was with his

<hi>Pope,</hi> who was in ≈øome diffidence with him, becau≈øe he had not offered him ≈øuccours as did others; that the <hi>Pope</hi> was well inclined, but the <hi>Cardinals</hi> did ill offices; that he would yet further imploy him≈øelfe for the <hi>Republique,</hi> and ≈øpeake in their behalfe, if they thought well; otherwi≈øe he knew not what he could do.</p>
            <p>When the propo≈øition of the <hi>Senate</hi> was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued in

<hi>Holine≈ø≈øe:</hi> But he ≈øaw very well that in declaring him≈øelfe he ≈øhould doe nothing el≈øe but render him≈øelfe ≈øu≈øpected on the one ≈øide, and con≈øequently
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:17285:105"/> depriue him≈øelfe of all power to be a Mediator for an accord, and vtterly to breake off the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie already begun. Vpon this rea≈øon he did not thinke fit to declare him≈øelfe for either partie, or to fauour the rea≈øons of the one or of the other; but remaining neutrall, to continue the treatie of agreement which might bee more profitable to both parties, then the declaration could be aduantageous to either of them: and ≈øo much the rather, becau≈øe he had a good hope very quickly to fini≈øh it; al≈øo that the <hi>Senate</hi> mu≈øt needs yeeld a little, becau≈øe the

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:17285:106"/> the Power giuen by <hi>God</hi> to all

But for that which the <hi>Senate</hi> then demanded, He held him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe obliged to conde≈øcend; Fir≈øt, becau≈øe in iudgement He approued the actions of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique:</hi> and ≈øecondly, ≈øince they had a great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>fidence in Him, that He ≈øhould ≈øhew him≈øelfe ingratefull and vniu≈øt, if He refu≈øed to protect a cau≈øe ≈øo righteous, wherein the

            <p>The <hi>Amba≈ø≈øadour</hi> of <hi>England</hi> at <hi>Venice</hi> ≈øpake on the ≈øame manner, ≈øaying, That he had parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Commandement from the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter,</hi> to oblige him vnder the Word of a <hi>King,</hi> to a neere Vnion with the <hi>Republique,</hi> to a≈ø≈øi≈øt them with Conn≈øell and Forces, as al≈øo to labour with
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:17285:107"/> all his Friends that they ≈øhould doe the ≈øame, nor for any ba≈øe ends or priuate intere≈øts, nor for to foment a diui≈øion, nor to come into concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or oppo≈øition with any other

Fir≈øt, for that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging him≈øelfe obliged to God for infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite fauours receiued from him, he thought it his duty to defend his Cau≈øe, that is, to con≈øerue that Power which his Diuine <hi>Maiestie</hi> had e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhed vpon earth. Secondly, becau≈øe of that Bond of Amity renewed with the <hi>Republique.</hi> The <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> hereunto added, that he had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the

<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> was called, and the <hi>Duke</hi> greatly complained vnto him, ≈øaying, That for a trifle they would prouoke the

            <p>In this Moneth of <hi>August</hi> was begunne a kinde of Warre by Writing, offen≈øiue on the <hi>Popes</hi> part, and defen≈øiue on the ≈øide of the <hi>Republique,</hi> handled on both parts with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much heat, and which ≈øerued greatly to the Negotiation which was in treating. For though it was certaine, that the <hi>Pope</hi> was the fir≈øt that a≈ø≈øailed the
<hi>Republique</hi> with this ≈øort of Weapons, neuerthele≈ø≈øe, he was ≈øo farre in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiour in the euent, that this was one of the principall Cau≈øes which incited him to an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, and he ≈øuffered more in his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the≈øe Writings, then the <hi>Republique,</hi> by the continuation of the Cen≈øures.</p>
            <p>The beginning and progre≈ø≈øe hereof was thus. After that the
<hi>Republique</hi> had hindered the execution of the <hi>Cen≈øures,</hi> by ≈øuch rea≈øons, ≈øuch dexteritie and con≈øtancie, as before wee haue mentioned, the <hi>Pope,</hi> who ≈øaw him≈øelfe
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:17285:111"/> blamed by the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> for his incon≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate proceedings in this affaire, trauelled on his ≈øide to finde ≈øome Rea≈øons, and commanded Some to ≈øtudie the≈øe matters: then in the end re≈øolued to publi≈øh his Motiues, and cau≈øed a Writing to be framed by <hi>Scipio Gobellucci</hi> (to whom he gaue for recompence the Office of a <hi>Secretarie,</hi> which he was wont to ≈øell,) which Writing he ≈øent to <hi>Mantua, Milan, Cremona,</hi> and <hi>Ferrara,</hi> to the end that it might be di≈øper≈øed in all Quarters. He ≈øent it likewi≈øe into
<hi>Spaine</hi> to his <hi>Nuntio,</hi> not only for his In≈øtruction, but al≈øo that it might be diuulged. Hereupon at <hi>Venice</hi> ≈øome propo≈øed that it was nece≈ø≈øarie to publi≈øh in like ≈øort the Rea≈øons of the
<hi>Repub.</hi> as well to oppo≈øe the fore≈øaid Writing, as becau≈øe it was a thing earne≈øtly de≈øired by the Subiects; and ≈øo much the more, for that hauing in their <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of the 6. of <hi>May,</hi> ≈øpoken of the nullitie of the <hi>Monitorie,</hi> it ≈øeemed requi≈øite that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons thereof ≈øhould bee explained and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and how the <hi>Letters</hi> of the <hi>Duke</hi> were ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by good and cleare arguments. And that which incited them yet more, was an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice that the <hi>Ie≈øuites,</hi> no le≈ø≈øe pa≈ø≈øionate in this affaire then the <hi>Pope</hi> him≈øelfe, went vp and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:17285:112"/> downe ≈øaying, per≈øwading, and declaiming in their Chaires and al≈øo writ vnto their adherents within the
<hi>State,</hi> that if the <hi>Republique</hi> had any Rea≈øons they would haue manife≈øted them: but that it ≈øufficed them in generall to ≈øay they had many Rea≈øons, being not able to particularize in any. Others ≈øaid that they had done enough for a ≈øufficient defence, and that it was not meet to ≈øay any more till they were forced: and this adui≈øe preuailed, for the great reuerence which the <hi>Republique</hi> carried to the <hi>See Apo≈øtolique:</hi> thinking it more fit to faile in ≈øome point of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, then to giue any ≈øigne of di≈øre≈øpect vnto that <hi>See,</hi> although they had receiued from it ≈øo manife≈øt iniuries. Yet it was not po≈ø≈øible to retaine ≈øome liuely wits, that they ≈øhould not write ≈øomewhat by ≈øtealth; hence there came abroad diuers Di≈øcour≈øes on both ≈øides, but yet onely in hand-writing. Diuers <hi>Letters</hi> were al≈øo written vnder fained Names to gaine the more credit, and in particular, one in the Name of the <hi>Senate</hi> vnto the <hi>Cities</hi> their Subiects. It is true (as hath beene ≈øaid) that there was one written and read in all the Coun≈øels of <hi>Cities,</hi> but not any Copies thereof were giuen to any. It may be that ≈øome per≈øon of learning hauing
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:17285:112"/> heard it read, and committing it (as he thought) to memorie, did afterwards ≈øet downe in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting rather that which he imagined he had heard then that which he heard indeed; or el≈øe, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ≈øtile of the <hi>Senate</hi> too mode≈øt, too re≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and reuerent, he adioyned thereunto of his owne ≈øome biting and eager words to fit it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the ta≈øte of the vulgar, and ≈øo let it runne vnder hand among the People. But at <hi>Milan</hi> there fell out an accident of mo≈øt pernicious con≈øequence, where ≈øome <hi>Ecclefia≈øtiques</hi> of great qualitie cau≈øed to imprint (without the name of the Author or of the Place) a Writing of one ≈øheet of paper very ≈øeditious, wherein was affirmed, again≈øt all ≈øound doctrine, that Mariages within the <hi>State</hi> of the
<hi>Republique</hi> were inualide, the Matrimoniall coniunction Adultery, and the Children all Ba≈øtards; that it was not onely lawfull, but euen meritorious, for <hi>Pa≈øtors</hi> to abandon their Flockes. And to conceale the Place where this was printed, they forbade the <hi>Printer</hi> very ≈øtraitly, euen vnder paine of <hi>Cen≈øures,</hi> that he ≈øhould not giue any one <hi>Copie</hi> thereof within <hi>Milan.</hi> The ≈øheet was therefore di≈øtributed in the Confines of <hi>Berga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, Bre≈øcia</hi> and
<hi>Crema.</hi> To contradict this Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:17285:113"/> a certaine Per≈øon publi≈øhed ≈øome Treati≈øes written 150. yeeres agoe by <hi>Iohn Ger≈øon,</hi> ≈øo well fitted to the affaires of this time that they ≈øeem'd to be written on this occa≈øion, and ≈øuch as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely at this day none could write ≈øo well and ≈øo re≈øolutely. Hereunto was adioyned a <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> without the name of the Author, whereby the <hi>Curates</hi> were exhorted to take care of their Churches, and not to feare the offence of <hi>God</hi> by not ob≈øeruing the <hi>Interdict.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Inqui≈øition</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> the 27. of
<hi>Iune,</hi> prohibited by name this la≈øt Writing, and al≈øo the others not yet imprinted, vnder paine of Excommunication for them that read or kept them: alledging for rea≈øon, that they contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned many propo≈øitions, ra≈øh, ≈øcandalous, ≈ølan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous, ≈øeditious, ≈øchi≈ømaticall and hereticall, with this clau≈øe, <hi>re≈øpectiue,</hi> to make all ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous. In the end, they brake off ≈øilence at <hi>Rome,</hi> whence came out a little Booke of
<hi>Cardinall Bellarmines</hi> again≈øt the Treati≈øes of <hi>Ger≈øon,</hi> and a little after the Admonition of <hi>Cardinall Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> full of railing ≈øpeeches and detractions, as al≈øo a Di≈øcour≈øe of <hi>Cardinall Colonna,</hi> hoping by ≈øuch Writings to moue the fidelitie of all ≈øorts of per≈øons; fora≈ømuch as <hi>Card. Colonna</hi>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:17285:113"/> had indeuoured to terrifie the
<hi>Prelates</hi> and other <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øtiques</hi> placed in the greate≈øt charges by the feare of <hi>Cen≈øures,</hi> and the priuation of their Dignities and Benefices. <hi>Card. Bellarmine</hi> aimed to ≈øhake the deuout con≈øciences by exalting the authoritie of the <hi>Pope</hi> ≈øo far as to make it equall to that of <hi>God.</hi> And <hi>Card. Baronius</hi> thought by his reuiling and declaiming to draw to his cau≈øe all learned Per≈øons. They did not beleeue at <hi>Rome</hi> that any would be found ≈øo bold as to oppo≈øe him≈øelfe to the reputation of the≈øe great
<hi>Cardinals,</hi> con≈øidering their high and eminent qualitie; as al≈øo they hoped to finde that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance among the people which they had long laboured to breed and bring in. But at <hi>Venice,</hi> to the end that no weake con≈øcience might be troubled by the Hyperbolees of <hi>Card. Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> he was ≈øpeedily an≈øwered, to di≈øcouer the truth, and to ≈øhew vnto all what obedience a <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> owes to the Soueraigne
<hi>Bi≈øhop;</hi> where al≈øo the publique Rea≈øons were manife≈øted, &amp; the three Ordinances of the <hi>Republique</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, together with their Authority to iudge and puni≈øh <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øtiques,</hi> which the
<hi>Pope</hi> in his <hi>Monitorie</hi> had oppugned; with other Writings, intituled, <hi>Con≈øiderations and Adui≈øes.</hi> And in as
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:17285:114"/> much as it ≈øeemed nece≈ø≈øarie to giue account to all the world, that the commandement made by the <hi>Republique</hi> for the continuation of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Seruice was iu≈øt and lawfull, they iudged expedient to proue it, by a <hi>Treati≈øe</hi> of the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict:</hi> and withall the <hi>Senate</hi> gaue permi≈ø≈øion to imprint other Bookes in fauour of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, prouided that men ≈øhould ob≈øerue herein the Lawes which the <hi>State</hi> pre≈øcribed, that is, that there ≈øhould be nothing written contrary to faith, good maners, &amp; the Authoritie of
<hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> And becau≈øe the <hi>Inqui≈øitor</hi> was not able to examine all Writings which were pre≈øented to be allowed to the Pre≈ø≈øe, there were deputed fiue <hi>Diuines</hi> together with the <hi>Patriarchall Vicar</hi> and the <hi>Diuine</hi> of the <hi>Repub.</hi> to take care of tho≈øe matters.</p>
            <p>As ≈øoone as the≈øe fore≈øaid Writings appeared in <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Inqui≈øition</hi> pre≈øently cen≈øured them, by particular name, becau≈øe (as they ≈øaid) they contained here≈øies, errors and ≈øcandals, with the ordinary clau≈øe, <hi>re≈øpectiu√®:</hi> and adioyned a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of all other Writings which ≈øhould be made again≈øt the
<hi>Interdict,</hi> whether in Print or Manu≈øcript, ≈øo as they might not be read or kept without incurring the penalty of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:17285:114"/> and re≈øeruation of their ab≈øolution. The≈øe prohibitions which might (con≈øidering the terrors of Excommunication) haue repre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed all Writings to be made in fauour of the
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique,</hi> did not with≈øtanding produce a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect, fora≈ømuch as many did hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that rea≈øon could not ≈øtand on their ≈øide, who would not ≈øuffer the Rea≈øons of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be read and publi≈øhed. Others ≈øaid, that the≈øe three <hi>Cardinals</hi> had di≈øgui≈øed the truth, and would not that it ≈øhould be di≈øcouered. Others thought ≈øtrange that all Writings which might be made were prohibited; as if they pretended to haue the ≈øpirit of prophecie to fore≈øee that men could write nothing good, or el≈øe of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to extingui≈øh indifferently the good with the euill. There were ≈øome who from this Prohibition collected, that in tho≈øe Writings was nothing worthy of Cen≈øure, ≈øeeing that the
<hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> had not the boldne≈ø≈øe to note a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny particular, and by this Aduerbe <hi>Re≈øpectiu√®,</hi> they had re≈øerued to them≈øelues a ≈øhrowd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt all obiections. Whereupon, ≈øome propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed that for their owne defence again≈øt ≈øuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries, it was meet by publique decree to prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite all Writings compo≈øed in fauour of the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:17285:115"/> 
               <hi>Pope.</hi> But others repre≈øented that this would be to imitate that which they reprehended in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: that the free cour≈øe of the≈øe Writings would be for the aduantage of the
<hi>Republique,</hi> and that hereby men ≈øhould ≈øee that on their part no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was palliated or di≈øgui≈øed, neither that they di≈øtru≈øted the iudgement of the World vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they had done. This opinion preuailed in ≈øuch ≈øort, that not onely the Writings in this Cau≈øe were tolerated, but al≈øo the publique fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of them permitted, and Liberty giuen to bring them into the <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching them that held for the <hi>Pope,</hi> it is to be noted, that all that time which pa≈ø≈øed from <hi>Iuly</hi> to that <hi>Aprill</hi> wherein the Peace was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, all ≈øorts of Per≈øons ≈øtriued to be writing to gaine the good grace of his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there were publi≈øhed many Treati≈øes, as well of <hi>Ie≈øuites</hi> as of others, partly vnder true names, partly vnder fained; to which Learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> made an≈øwers to repell their ≈ølanders, and to confure tho≈øe fal≈øe Doctrines which they attempted to ≈øcatter.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Writers was, in ≈øumme; That
<hi>God</hi> hath e≈øtabli≈øhed two Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the World, the one Spirituall, and the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:17285:115"/> other Temporall, each one of them being ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and independent vpon the other. The one is the
<hi>Eccle≈øia≈øticall</hi> Mini≈øtery, the other is the <hi>Ciuill</hi> Gouernment. Of the Spirituall he hath giuen the care vnto the
<hi>Apo≈øtles,</hi> and to their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øors; of the Temporall the charge is put in the hands of <hi>Princes,</hi> in ≈øuch ≈øort, that one may not intermeddle in that which appertaines to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no power to abrogate the Lawes of <hi>Princes</hi> in Temporall matters, nor to depriue them of their <hi>E≈øtates,</hi> or free their Subiects from their Allegeance which they owe vnto them; that to depo≈øe <hi>Kings</hi> from their <hi>E≈øtates</hi> is a new thing, neuer attempted till with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this fiue hundred years, again≈øt the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and the examples of
<hi>Ie≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> and of his <hi>Saints;</hi> and that to teach that in ca≈øe of controuer≈øie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the <hi>Pope</hi> and a <hi>Prince,</hi> it is lawful to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øue him by frauds and open force, or that the Subiects which rebell again≈øt him, doe by that meanes obtaine remi≈ø≈øion of their ≈øinnes, is a Doctrine ≈øeditious and ≈øacrilegious; that
<hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øia≈øticall</hi> men by Diuine Law are not exempted from the Secular Power, neither in their per≈øons nor in their goods; but haue receiued from godly and deuout <hi>Princes,</hi> ≈øince <hi>Con≈øtantine</hi> the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:17285:116"/> Great, vntill <hi>Fredericke</hi> the ≈øecond, diuers Priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges both reall and per≈øonall, greater or le≈ø≈øer according to the exigence of times and places; which hath bin al≈øo practi≈øed in other Realmes and Principalities, being alwayes exempted (as well by <hi>Emperours,</hi> as other <hi>Princes)</hi> from the power of inferiour <hi>Magi≈øtrates,</hi> but not from their owne Soueraigne authority. That the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions granted by <hi>Popes</hi> vnto the Order of the
<hi>Clergie</hi> haue not beene admitted in ≈øome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and in others admitted only in part, and that they haue been valide only ≈øo farre as they haue beene receiued; that notwith≈øtanding any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption, the <hi>Prince</hi> hath ≈øtill Power ouer their per≈øons and goods when≈øoeuer nece≈ø≈øity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtraines him to ≈øerue him≈øelfe of them And if at any time they ≈øhould abu≈øe ≈øuch Exemption to the perturbation of the publique tranquillitie, that the <hi>Prince</hi> is obliged to prouide a remedy. Another point of their Doctrine was, that the <hi>Pope</hi> ought not to thinke him≈øelfe infallible, vnle≈ø≈øe where <hi>God</hi> hath promi≈øed him his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine a≈ø≈øi≈øtance; which ≈øome Moderne Doctors ≈øay to bee onely in nece≈ø≈øary points of Faith, and when hee v≈øes fit meanes to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe, of diuine Inuocation and of <hi>Eccle≈øia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øticall</hi>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:17285:116"/> con≈øultations. But the authority of Bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and Loo≈øing ought to bee vnder≈øtood with this Caution, <hi>claue non crrante,</hi> ≈øeeing God hath commanded the <hi>Pa≈øtor</hi> to follow the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Iu≈øtice of the Cau≈øe, and not his owne inclination: that when the <hi>Pope</hi> vpon any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with <hi>Princes,</hi> pa≈ø≈øes on to thunder out his Cen≈øures, it is permitted vnto the Doctors to con≈øider whether he hath proceeded <hi>claue er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante aut non errante.</hi> And the
<hi>Prince</hi> when he is a≈ø≈øured that the Cen≈øures thundred again≈øt him, his <hi>E≈øtates</hi> and ≈øubiects are inualide, may and ought, for the con≈øeruation of publique peace, hinder the execution thereof, pre≈øeruing his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the reuerence due to the <hi>Church;</hi> and that according to the doctrine of S. <hi>Augu≈øtine,</hi> the Excommunication of a multitude, or of Him who commandeth, and is followed by a great number of people, is pernicious and ≈øacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; that the new name of Blinde Obedience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ted by <hi>Ignatius Loiola</hi> vnknown to the Ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t <hi>Church</hi> and to al good Diuines, taketh away the e≈ø≈øence of that vertue, (which ought to work by certain knowledge and election,) expo≈øeth vs to the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ger of offending
<hi>God,</hi> doth not excu≈øe him who is deceiued by the Gho≈øtly Father, and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:17285:117"/> may ingender ≈øeditions, as it hath beene ≈øeene within the≈øe forty yeares ≈øince that abu≈øe hath beene introduced.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, the Doctrine of the <hi>Romane</hi> Writers, or
<hi>Papalins,</hi> affirmed; That the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Power of <hi>Princes</hi> is ≈øubordinate to the Power <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øticall,</hi> and ≈øubiect to it; con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath authority to depriue
<hi>Princes</hi> of their <hi>E≈øtates</hi> for their faults and errors which they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mit in Gouernment, yea though they haue not committed any fault, when the <hi>Pope</hi> ≈øhall iudge it fit for the good of the <hi>Church;</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> may free Subiects fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and from their oath of Fidelity which they owe vnto their <hi>Princes,</hi> in which ca≈øe they are obliged to ca≈øt off all ≈øubiection, and euen to pur≈øue the
<hi>Prince,</hi> if the <hi>Pope</hi> command it. And although they all agreed to hold the≈øe Maximes, yet they were not at accord touching the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; for they that were touched with a little ≈øhame, ≈øaid, ≈øo great an authority did not re≈øide in the <hi>Pope,</hi> becau≈øe <hi>Ie≈øus Chri≈øt</hi> had giuen him any Temporall authority, but becau≈øe this was nece≈ø≈øary for the Spirituall. Wherefore <hi>Ie≈øus Chri≈øt</hi> giuing Spirituall authority, had giuen al≈øo <hi>indirectly</hi> the Temporall: which was a vain ≈øhift,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:17285:117"/> ≈øeeing they made no other difference then of Words. But the greater part of the≈øe men ≈øpake plainly, that the
<hi>Pope</hi> hath all Authority in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, both Spirituall and Temporall, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all <hi>Princes</hi> of the World no otherwi≈øe then ouer his Subiects and va≈ø≈øals: that he might cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them for any fault what≈øoeuer: that he is a Temporall Monarque ouer all the earth: that from any Temporall Soueraigne <hi>Prince</hi> men might appeale to the <hi>Pope:</hi> that he might giue Lawes to all <hi>Princes,</hi> and annull tho≈øe which were made by Them. For the Exemption of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle≈øiastiques,</hi> they all with one voyce denied, that they held it by the grace and priuiledge of
<hi>Princes,</hi> although their Lawes to that purpo≈øe, Con≈øtitutions, and Priuiledges be yet extant; but they were not agreed how they had receiued it, ≈øome of them affirming that it was <hi>de iure diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no;</hi> others that it came by Con≈øtitutions of <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Councels.</hi> But all con≈øented vpon this, that they are not Subiects to the <hi>Prince</hi> euen in ca≈øe of trea≈øon, and that they are not bound to obey the Lawes vnle≈ø≈øe it were <hi>vi directiu√¢:</hi> And ≈øome pa≈ø≈øed ≈øo farre as to ≈øay, that the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle≈øiastiques</hi> ought to examine whether the Lawes &amp; Commands of the Prince beiu≈øt, and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:17285:118"/> whether the people be obliged to obey them, and that they owe not vnto the <hi>Prince</hi> either contributions, or cu≈øtomes, or obedience: that the <hi>Pope</hi> cannot erre or faile becau≈øe he hath the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> and therefore that it is nece≈ø≈øary to obey his Commandements whether they be iu≈øt or vniu≈øt: that to Him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaines the clearing of all difficulties, ≈øo as it is not lawfull for any to depart from his re≈øolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor to make reply though the re≈øolution be vniu≈øt: that though all the World differ in opinion from the
<hi>Pope,</hi> yet it is meet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe to yeeld to Him, and he is not excu≈øed from ≈øinne who followes not his aduice, though all the world iudge it to be fal≈øe. Their bookes were al≈øo full of ≈øuch other Maximes, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is a <hi>God</hi> vpon earth, a Sunne of iu≈øtice, a Light of religion; that the iudgement and ≈øentence of <hi>God</hi> and the
<hi>Pope</hi> is one ≈øame thing, as al≈øo the Tribunall and the Court of the
<hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>God:</hi> that to doubt of the power of the <hi>Pope</hi> is as much as to doubt of the power of God. And it is notable what <hi>Card. Bellarmine</hi> hath boldly written, that, to re≈øtraine the obedience due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Pope</hi> to things concerning the Saluation of the Soule, is to bring it to nothing: that Saint
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:17285:118"/> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> appealed to <hi>Cae≈øar</hi> who was not his Iudge, and not to S. <hi>Peter</hi> le≈øt the by-≈øtanders ≈øhould haue laughed at him: that the holy Bi≈øhops of old ≈øhewed them≈øelues ≈øubject to Emperors, becau≈øe the times ≈øo required. Others adioyned further, that then it was meet to introduce the Empire of the
<hi>Pope</hi> by little and little, it being a thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øea≈øonable to de≈øpoile <hi>Princes</hi> newly conuerted of their <hi>E≈øtates,</hi> and al≈øo to permit ≈øome thing vnto them for to intere≈ø≈øe them. Other like di≈øcour≈øes they made, which many godly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons abhorred to read, and reputed them bla≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the manner of treating on the one part and on the other, was very different; ina≈ømuch as the Writings of the <hi>Popes</hi> parti≈øans and e≈øpecially of the <hi>Ie≈øuites,</hi> were full of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, detractions, iniuries and ≈ølanders again≈øt the
<hi>Republique;</hi> and their <hi>Doctors,</hi> full al≈øo of many motiues to ≈øedition. But the Writings of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> following the intention of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> were full of all kinds of re≈øpect vnto the
<hi>Pope,</hi> and of mode≈øtie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> towards them who had written in his fauour; pre≈ø≈øing the matter in hand without digre≈ø≈øions, and without nothing the faults of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> not for want of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:17285:119"/> good information (being ≈øo many and ≈øo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to all the World,) but onely to v≈øe all due ≈øeemeline≈ø≈øe; which is, not to pa≈ø≈øe from the matter to the per≈øons, as doe tho≈øe who faile of rea≈øons. All this may be euidently ≈øeene in the Recollections printed in diuers places and in ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Languages, wherein are contained the Writings of both parties.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not well plea≈øed with the publication of the≈øe Writings, and they ≈øignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> that it was better to proceed herein by his ≈øole Authority; fora≈ømuch as Books gaue matter of di≈øcour≈øe vnto the World, and occa≈øion to each one to frame his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with diminution of the <hi>Popes</hi> authority. E≈øpecially that they of his ≈øide had too far trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon the Authority of
<hi>Princes,</hi> which could not bring any aduantage to the Church; as al≈øo that they did more abound with reuilings then with rea≈øons: be≈øides that, each propo≈øition drew to it ≈øelfe an An≈øwer. Al≈øo Father
<hi>So≈øa</hi> a <hi>Franci≈øcane</hi> was reprehended, for Writing in
<hi>Spani≈øh</hi> vpon this matter, and he was inioyned to call in all the Copies of his Booke, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he did. And at the in≈øtance of the
<hi>Nuntio</hi> they con≈øented that all the≈øe Writings
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:17285:119"/> ≈øhould be forbidden, not by the

            <p>By occa≈øion of the≈øe Writings, in <hi>Milan</hi> was like to haue followed a great di≈øorder. For as they were greedily read by ≈øome in ≈øecret, ≈øo were they by ≈øome ill affected, bitterly reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with calumnies and iniuries (familiar to the <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øtiques:)</hi> which
<hi>Antony Paulucci</hi> Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Repub.</hi> could not endure, and gaue te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtimony of his di≈ølike. Whereupon a Proce≈ø≈øe was formed again≈øt him in the <hi>Inqui≈øition,</hi> which being come to his knowledge, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained thereof to the <hi>Count de Fuentes,</hi> who maruailed at their pre≈øumption, and promi≈øed to take ≈øpeedy order for his quietne≈ø≈øe. But a
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:17285:120"/> few daies after a <hi>Notary</hi> of the
<hi>Office</hi> cited him in the name of the <hi>Inqui≈øitor;</hi> to whom he an≈øwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he was a publique Per≈øon, and vnder the protection of the
<hi>Count,</hi> and that he owed no obedience to any be≈øides his
<hi>Prince;</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Notary to proceed again≈øt him on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other fa≈øhion. The <hi>Count</hi> aduerti≈øed hereof, ≈øent for the
<hi>Inqui≈øitor,</hi> and ≈øignified to <hi>Paulucci</hi> that he might come ≈øecurely to the Audience. Yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Count</hi> had talked with the
<hi>Inqui≈øitor,</hi> he ≈øaid to <hi>Paulucci,</hi> that he publi≈øhed too freely the Rea≈øons of the <hi>Repub.</hi> and that he ≈øhould doe well to goe to the <hi>Inqui≈øitor,</hi> who had one word to ≈øpeake vnto him, and no more. <hi>Paulucci</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øed to ≈øubmit him≈øelfe to any whom≈øoeuer without Commi≈ø≈øion from his <hi>Prince.</hi> The <hi>Count</hi> offred to ≈øend along the <hi>Trea≈øurer Torni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ello</hi> to accompany him to the
<hi>Office,</hi> who ≈øhould ≈øtay with him till the <hi>Inqui≈øitor</hi> had taken his an≈øwere, and then conduct him backe vnto his hou≈øe. For which
<hi>Paulucci</hi> thanked him, but ≈øaid hee could not doe it without leaue. Wherefore the <hi>Count</hi> ≈øent to tell him that hee would not trouble him any further, or take more knowledge of the matter. The <hi>Secretary</hi> gaue aduice of all to <hi>Venice;</hi> whereupon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:17285:120"/> was pre≈øently made to the
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and all that their
<hi>Secretary</hi> had done was approued. The <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> hauing written here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vnto the <hi>Count,</hi> he called <hi>Paulucci</hi> telling him, that he had ≈øpoken too boldly of the≈øe affaires, and that it behoued him to giue no ≈øcandall. To which <hi>Paulucci</hi> an≈øwered, that he hoped his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi> would take order for the time to come, that none ≈øhould giue him any occa≈øion. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>Inqui≈øitor</hi> gaue him to vnder≈øtand, that, not as <hi>Inqui≈øitor,</hi> but as his friend, he de≈øired to ≈øpeake with him in ≈øome priuate hou≈øe. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered, that before this difficulty he was ≈øtil rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ≈øpeake with him as a particular Friend, but now he could not, and he would not doe it.</p>
            <p>But to returne to the treaty of Peace, which ≈øtill continued, not with≈øtanding that either part defended their Rea≈øons by writing: in the end of <hi>Augu≈øt</hi> was made a greater ouerture to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, which almo≈øt gaue perfection vnto the Treaty, although afterwards many Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations pa≈ø≈øed without effect. On the ≈øeuenteenth of <hi>Augu≈øt, Moun≈øieur de Fre≈øne</hi> came to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> with <hi>Letters</hi> from the <hi>King</hi> of the fourth of <hi>Augu≈øt,</hi> wherein he te≈øtified his great di≈øplea≈øure for the Differences betweene the

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:17285:121"/> 
               <hi>Republique,</hi> fearing the mi≈øchiefes which might en≈øue: that in regard of the place which he held in <hi>Chri≈øt endome,</hi> for his Deuotion to the <hi>See A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtolique,</hi> and for the Amity which he had with the <hi>Republique,</hi> he was moued to interpo≈øe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe, de≈øiring to finde ≈øome hone≈øt Compo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but that he ≈øhould be hindered to execute this his laudable de≈øigne, if the
<hi>Republique</hi> did not aid him by ≈øuch meanes as depended vpon them: that he had enioyned <hi>Fre≈øne</hi> his <hi>Amba≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi> to exhort his <hi>Serenity</hi> to continue his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Prudence, and the affection which he had towards <hi>God,</hi> towards <hi>Chri≈øtendom,</hi> and towards the <hi>State;</hi> and to a≈ø≈øure him that his intention aimed meerely at the con≈øeruation of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the <hi>Republique.</hi> The
<hi>Letter</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing read, <hi>Fre≈øne</hi> made his propo≈øition, ≈øaying, that the <hi>King</hi> was di≈øgu≈øted for that he could not draw from them any thing but generall words in a bu≈øine≈ø≈øe ≈øo important, and ≈øo pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing: that he doubted the new in≈øtance which now he made with ≈øincerity, would bring di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, and be interpreted to other ends than he intended; neuerthele≈ø≈øe being a friend, and obliged to the <hi>Republique,</hi> for that which ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they had done in his behalfe, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:17285:121"/> their courte≈øies, as al≈øo fore-≈øeeing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences which might fall out, he was ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for this quarrell, and had interpo≈øed him≈øelfe (not being de≈øired,) to ≈øtay the≈øe euils, which doubtle≈ø≈øe would increa≈øe, if the <hi>Repub.</hi> would not aide him: that the <hi>Pope</hi> had conde≈øcended to hone≈øt Conditions, and ≈øuch, as he ≈øeemed not to demand any thing contrary to the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and Liberty of the <hi>Republique;</hi> that the <hi>King</hi> would be di≈øplea≈øed, if (the <hi>Pope</hi> hauing iu≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his Cau≈øe to the World in ≈øome ≈øort, though in effect all iudged for the <hi>Repub.)</hi> they ≈øhould re≈øi≈øt the Motions of al <hi>Chri≈øtian Princes,</hi> in which ca≈øe he could not fauour them: as otherwi≈øe he was purpo≈øed to doe, if the <hi>Pope</hi> again≈øt all iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice would force their Libertie, and endamage their Gouernment, for then he would employ all his Forces, all his Armes, and his <hi>E≈øtates</hi> for the Seruice of his <hi>Serenity. Fre≈øne</hi> added fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that His <hi>Maie≈øty</hi> was ≈øo much di≈øplea≈øed for that he could not draw from the <hi>Republique</hi> any particular Inten≈øion in this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, that Hee was minded once to re≈øt him≈øelfe and to meddle no more; but yet he had re≈øolued to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard one Triall more, and to make one Reply, praying the <hi>Senate</hi> for his ≈øake to be confident in
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:17285:122"/> him, as in their Friend, and ≈øo farre as they might to yeeld, and giue ≈øome ≈øatisfaction vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> a≈ø≈øuring them that his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> would re≈øt content with a little, if by any meanes he might ≈øaue his Reputation. And thereupon the
<hi>Amba≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øador</hi> propo≈øed two things: The one was, that the
<hi>Senate</hi> would ≈øu≈øpend the Execution of the Lawes, and the Prote≈øtation publi≈øhed again≈øt the <hi>Monitory</hi> of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> vpon condition that his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> would doe as much with his <hi>Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> and with the Cen≈øures, for foure or ≈øix mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, during which time they might treat of the Merit of the Lawes that were que≈øtioned. And here he ≈øhe that the Su≈øpen≈øion of the Laws was a thing that might be ea≈øily yeelded; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the Lawes being Prohibitiue, the Ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation whereof con≈øi≈øted in not doing that which they forbad, a Su≈øpen≈øion of them could not bring any innouation. But for the Su≈øpen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Prote≈øtation, he did not de≈øire that it might be done in ≈øuch pa≈ø≈øages, wherein the actions of the <hi>Republique</hi> were proued iu≈øt, and con≈øequently the Cen≈øures pronounced void and inualide, but only in ≈øuch clau≈øes wherein they ≈øeemed to breake off friend≈øhip with <hi>Pope:</hi> that if this manner did not intirely ≈øatisfie, ≈øome
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:17285:122"/> other more conuenient might be deui≈øed, the thing in it ≈øelfe being hone≈øt, the que≈øtion only of words: that if the terme of ≈øix moneths for the Su≈øpen≈øion of the <hi>Monitory</hi> did not ≈øeeme ≈øufficient, the <hi>Pope</hi> might be ea≈øily induced to prolong it. Another thing propo≈øed, was, that the Pri≈øoners might be rendered without preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the Cau≈øe of the <hi>Republique;</hi> that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious gone out of <hi>Venice,</hi> by rea≈øon of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict,</hi> might returne, and the <hi>Pope</hi> would Su≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the <hi>Monitory</hi> for ≈øome time. But the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈ø≈øador</hi> pa≈ø≈øed lightly ouer this Propo≈øition, ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That it was not the Intention of the <hi>King,</hi> that any thing ≈øhould be done again≈øt the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie or to the di≈øaduantage of the <hi>Repub.</hi> and that if either of the≈øe Propo≈øitions were to their preiudice, he was content to let them pa≈ø≈øe in ≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; that he had propo≈øed them not thinking them preiudicial, but if they ≈øhewed the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>trary, he had done. He de≈øired them further to con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that it was nece≈ø≈øary to giue ≈øome apparent Occa≈øion vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> that he might retract, becau≈øe it was neuer heard that a
<hi>Pope</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked his <hi>Bulles,</hi> excepting at
<hi>Con≈øtance</hi> by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>Councell;</hi> that if it ≈øeemed indecent and again≈øt the Cu≈øtome of the <hi>Republique</hi> to
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:17285:123"/> correct their Lawes at the in≈øtance of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> or to render Pri≈øoners vpon his demand, for the≈øe things might be found ≈øome temper, ≈øo as the things afore≈øaid might be done at the reque≈øt of the <hi>King,</hi> and to gratifie Him, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any mention of the <hi>Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Senate</hi> this Matter was put in Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; where, after they had well examined all the Rea≈øons, and con≈øidered withall the Perils which followed vpon the continuation of the≈øe Differences, they preferred with one ioynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent, before all other re≈øpects, the pre≈øeruation of their Liberty, which without doubt had beene violated, if the
<hi>Senate</hi> had beene con≈øtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnder any pretext to take away the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their Lawes. For the point of giuing vp the Pri≈øoners in gratification to the <hi>King,</hi> they thought this not to touch vpon their Liberty, although they ≈øaw it was de≈øired to giue ≈øatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction vnto the
<hi>Pope;</hi> in as much as it was a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular fact which drew not with it any con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that the like ought to be done in times to come. And here there were two opinions; ≈øome propo≈øed that onely One of the ≈øhould be rendered, others were of aduice that they ≈øhould render Both. And this opinion preuailed, becau≈øe
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:17285:123"/> if the one were relea≈øed, the deliuerance of the other (the ca≈øe being like) could not be well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øed; and be≈øides, if the <hi>Senate</hi> at fir≈øt ≈øhould not yeeld ≈øo farre as they might, by this meanes a gate might be open to other preiudiciall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; but if they ≈øhould con≈øent ≈øo farre as was po≈ø≈øible, they ≈øhould be freed from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie of new Propo≈øitions, and the <hi>King</hi> Obliged to turne him≈øelfe vpon the <hi>Pope.</hi> They al≈øo con≈øidered that by yeelding one Pri≈øoner to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> they ≈øhould inuite ≈øome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Prince</hi> to demand the other, which if they refu≈øed, he would re≈øt ill ≈øatisfied; and if they granted him, the mo≈øt
<hi>Chri≈øtian King</hi> would iudge the fauour done to him to be but ≈ømall. So then re≈øoluing to yeeld the two Pri≈øoners vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>King,</hi> the
<hi>Senate</hi> an≈øwered to the Propo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador,</hi> thanking his <hi>Maiesty</hi> for his mediation, and adioyned, that as the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> tooke in good part all that was done by his <hi>Maie≈øtie,</hi> ≈øo they prayed him not to interpret a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øe that they had not conde≈øcended to any Particularity, in as much as they knew not what to ≈øay in ≈øuch a difficulty, offered again≈øt all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, and aboue beleefe, contrary to the Libertie and Gouernment of their
<hi>E≈øtate,</hi> which they
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:17285:124"/> were a≈ø≈øured (and it was certaine) his
<hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> would not preiudice. That it was ea≈øie to ≈øee whereat aimed the De≈øignes of the <hi>Pope,</hi> who, ≈øeeing that the Iu≈øtice of the <hi>Repub.</hi> for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and ground of the Cau≈øe, was knowne and confe≈ø≈øed by all, not only out of <hi>Italy,</hi> but euen in
<hi>Rome,</hi> would therefore to take aduantage find di≈øorder in the forme and maner of proceeding; wherein the Iu≈øtice of the <hi>Republique</hi> was ≈øo cleare, that it was manife≈øt to all, the Errours of the <hi>Pope</hi> ≈øo gro≈ø≈øe, that they could not be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed. Wherefore, that it was not iu≈øt to correct the Faults of another with their owne damage and di≈øhonour, and ≈øince others had cau≈øed the≈øe Di≈øorders, it was not for the
<hi>Senate</hi> to remedie them: they had done ≈øufficiently, in that hauing receiued in≈øupportable Iniuries, they had procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with exemplary moderation, doing nothing herein but for their nece≈ø≈øary defence. That the Que≈øtions moued by the <hi>Pope</hi> in the beginning of the≈øe differences were very vnrea≈øonable, but that which was done after was intolerable, the
<hi>Republique</hi> being a≈ø≈øaulted by Treacheries, and practi≈øes of Sedition to moue the people, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it ≈øelfe (which is mo≈øt of all) being by the≈øe meanes endangerd: that yet ≈øtill they were di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:17285:124"/> by the <hi>Pope;</hi> who vnder pretence of propo≈øitions and ≈øatisfactions of forme ≈øought to iu≈øtifie his Cau≈øe. That the <hi>Repub.</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding all this was ready to doe what they might, their Liberty remaining entire, but they could not con≈øent that it ≈øhould be dimini≈øhed in any fa≈øhion, without the high offence of God: That to ≈øu≈øpend their Lawes was nothing el≈øe but to confe≈ø≈øe a want of authority to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine them, which in effect was to cut the ≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes of Gouernment: con≈øidering that the que≈øtion was not onely of the≈øe Lawes, but of all others, as al≈øo of their Authority to rule and gouerne their
<hi>State,</hi> which mu≈øt needs be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded if they grant the <hi>Pope</hi> a power by his Cen≈øures to con≈øtraine them to a ≈øu≈øpen≈øion; a thing pernicious to the Liberty not only of the <hi>Repub:</hi> but of all ≈øoueraigne <hi>Princes</hi> who mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily re≈øt depriued of al Soueraignty when they ≈øubmit them≈øelues vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> who ≈øhall haue power by his Excommunications to force them to regulate their Lawes and Ordinances after his will. And that pretext of <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> Liberty will bring forth this effect, that no Law ≈øhall be exempt from the Cen≈øure of the <hi>Pope,</hi> ≈øeeing he attributeth to him≈øelfe Authority

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:17285:125"/> to define and determine, euen again≈øt the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of al the World, what Lawes are iu≈øt or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iu≈øt. That though the Lawes were prohibitiue, yet it followed not they might be ≈øu≈øpended without preiudice, ≈øince if the prohibitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> were taken a way, men had Liberty to do the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>trary, and euery ≈øu≈øpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øion implies a want either of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or of wi≈øedome, &amp; e≈øpecially to do it for feare or at the threatning of another nece≈ø≈øarily inferred a Subiection. That the <hi>Repub.</hi> receiued willingly the word of the <hi>King,</hi> to wit, that hee would doe nothing which might turne to their preiudice, and thereupon de≈øired to be excu≈øed if they did not conde≈øcend to this particular: that they had not propo≈øed any thing to his <hi>Maie≈øtie,</hi> as looking that the remedy ≈øhould come whence the euill it ≈øelfe, and all the≈øe di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders: But now in fauour of his <hi>Maie≈øtie,</hi> they were purpo≈øed to declare what they could doe if the <hi>Pope</hi> ≈øhould fir≈øt take away the Cen≈øures, and that to let the <hi>King</hi> ≈øee what inclination they had to Concord, and how willing they were to doe for his ≈øake what was po≈ø≈øible, (a fauour not to be yeelded to any other what≈øoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,) which was in ≈øumme and in particular, that when the <hi>King</hi> ≈øhould be a≈ø≈øured and haue
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:17285:125"/> the firme word of the <hi>Pope,</hi> that he would to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally take away the Cen≈øures, and put an end to all the≈øe Controuer≈øies: the <hi>Repub.</hi> in gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to his
<hi>Maie≈øtie,</hi> would render him the two Pri≈øoners, although they were guilty of great crimes, and would take away their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtation, ≈øauing yet ≈øtill their publique Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, and their Power to iudge the
<hi>Eccle≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a≈øtiques,</hi> when it ≈øhould be expedient for the
<hi>State.</hi> In conformity of this, the <hi>Senate</hi> al≈øo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered the Letter of the <hi>King,</hi> and gaue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their <hi>Amba≈ø≈ø. Priuli</hi> to ≈øpeake vnto him. The <hi>King</hi> thanked them, for that they had done for him what they would not for any other; and ≈øaid, that he was obliged to the <hi>Repub.</hi> for many good offices which he had receiued from them, and particularly for that they had admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him into the body of their Nobility. And for that which they had done in his fauour, that he would giue order to his <hi>Amba≈ø≈øadour</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> to pre≈ø≈øe the
<hi>Pope</hi> to be therewith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented: but that if he ≈øhould not con≈øent, and if nothing remained but a Su≈øpen≈øion of their Lawes, he hoped they would herein al≈øo yeel ≈øomewhat, ≈øeeing <hi>Fre≈øne</hi> had written vnto him that the Rea≈øons which they vrged to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:17285:126"/> were not pre≈øsing. The <hi>Amba≈ø≈ø. Priuli</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that they had ≈øignified all that could be done to
<hi>Fre≈øne,</hi> but happily he had not written all: and further he made remon≈øtrance to his <hi>Maie≈øtie,</hi> what great preiudice was done to the Authority of a Soueraigne <hi>Prince,</hi> if he were con≈øtrained to change his Lawes at the plea≈øure of another pa≈øsing from one Law to another, or to acknowledge that he borrowes from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all power of Gouerning. Which Di≈øcour≈øe being amplified by the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øadour,</hi> the
<hi>King</hi> conde≈øcended to ≈øay, that he would neuer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwade the

            <p>At the ≈øame time when the An≈øwer of the <hi>Senate</hi> was ≈øent into <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øadour</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> a≈ø≈øaied to make the <hi>Republique</hi> yeeld to ≈øome particular, and pre≈øenting him≈øelfe to the <hi>Duke,</hi> exhorted him to a Compo≈øition: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that it was nece≈ø≈øary to grant ≈øomething to the

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:17285:126"/> contented with all that had formerly beene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed, and therefore it was needfull to giue him more ample Commi≈ø≈øion; that it was not ≈øitting to ≈øtand vpon ≈ømall pointills with the <hi>Pope,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Vicar</hi> of <hi>Ie≈øus Chri≈øt;</hi> con≈øequently it was no ≈øhame to yeeld vnto him, and ≈øubmit to his Will; that he would propo≈øe this ouerture, to wit, that they ≈øhould make him

The <hi>Duke</hi> demanded what he meant by being <hi>Auogador,</hi> and what he would put in execution by meanes of that Charge? He an≈øwered, that they ≈øhould fir≈øt put him in that Charge, according to the cu≈øtome, which being done, he would to good purpo≈øe v≈øe his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. And he adioyned, that it was not meet ≈øubtilly to goe to worke, when men are to Treat with the <hi>Pope,</hi> but only to be very humble, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant in ≈øatisfactions, ≈øubmi≈ø≈øions, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience towards his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this Propo≈øition when the <hi>Senate</hi> deferred ≈øome daies to an≈øwer, the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> appeared againe, ≈øaying that he had very expre≈ø≈øe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements from his <hi>King,</hi> to moue the
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pub.</hi> to giue him ≈øome occa≈øion that he might
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:17285:127"/> pre≈øent him≈øelfe to the <hi>Pope:</hi> that he ≈øaw well the <hi>Republique</hi> to de≈øire the agreement no le≈ø≈øe than the <hi>Pope;</hi> that on both parts there wanted not good will, but all con≈øi≈øted in the meanes to execute, which vntill that time neither was able or willing to finde; that in this affaire, as in
<hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di≈øe</hi> each one de≈øired the end, but none would v≈øe the meanes proper thereunto. When the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> did not an≈øwer to this Propo≈øition, no more than to the former, the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> well iudging, that if he pre≈ø≈øed them too much, he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ≈øome vnplea≈øing an≈øwer, he ≈øignified vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that if they had not re≈øolued to yeeld ≈øomewhat according to his Petition, they ≈øhould rather deferre their an≈øwer, than reiect and deny him altogether.</p>
            <p>But ≈øome daies afterwards, this <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øent for touching that which happened at <hi>Durazzo</hi> (whereof we ≈øpake before,) after they had treated of that bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, Hee mode≈øtly complained that as yet they had not an≈øwered his late Propo≈øitions, adding yet that he did not demand an an≈øwer, although it appeared that he de≈øired it. To which the <hi>Prince</hi> by Decree of the <hi>Senate</hi> formerly made, an≈øwered, That ≈øince they could doe no more for the contentment of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:17285:127"/> the <hi>Pope</hi> than they had done, and ≈øo not ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie him by an an≈øwer, they had re≈øolued (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his de≈øire) not to an≈øwer at all. <hi>D. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigo</hi> replied, I will be then for the pre≈øent <hi>Auoga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> (≈øaid he) and I doe Su≈øpend the An≈øwer which the <hi>Senate</hi> hath made me, to the end that they may better adui≈øe them≈øelues, &amp; at length re≈øolue to Su≈øpend their Lawes to gratifie my <hi>King,</hi> and not the <hi>Pope.</hi> And he endeuoured to per≈øwade by many Rea≈øons, that as a Su≈øpen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the in≈øtance of the <hi>Pope</hi> might bring pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice, ≈øo it could not be any way preiudiciall to doe it in con≈øideration of another <hi>Prince;</hi> and for example alledged that his <hi>King,</hi> at the reque≈øt of the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> Su≈øpended the <hi>Edict</hi> of thirty for an hundred, and did not e≈øteeme that it was any diminution to his reputation: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he exhorted them to ballance the Su≈øpen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (a light thing) with the incommodities and dangers which might be cau≈øed by their re≈øolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and made in≈øtance to haue a new an≈øwer.</p>
            <p>While≈øt they were con≈øidering this Propo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being ≈øtill re≈øolued to yeeld nothing preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall to their Liberty, they receiued aduice how the <hi>Pope</hi> had erected in the beginning of
<hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> a new Congregation at <hi>Rome,</hi> called, <hi>The
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:17285:128"/> Congregation of Warre,</hi> with order that it ≈øhould be holden twice a week to Treat vpon the point of Warre: which gaue matter of di≈øcour≈øe not only in <hi>Rome,</hi> but thorowout
<hi>Italy.</hi> And fir≈øt for the extraordinary Name of the <hi>Congregation of Warre,</hi> it hath beene an ancient Cu≈øtome of the <hi>Court</hi> of
<hi>Rome,</hi> to couer the managing of Temporall things vnder Colours and Names Spirituall, whereas here on the contrary, the <hi>Pope</hi> being de≈øtitute of all meanes to make War (though he had de≈øire enough) made this vaine o≈øtentation of worldly Power, intitling this <hi>Congregation</hi> with the proud Name of <hi>Warre.</hi> And men maruailed ≈øo much the more, con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the quality of tho≈øe Men where of this <hi>Congregation</hi> was compo≈øed, who were all of a Profe≈ø≈øion vtterly vnexperienced and vnfit for ≈øuch affaires, fifteene <hi>Cardinalls</hi> being thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to called; in the choi≈øe whereof the <hi>Pope</hi> di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in whom hee placed his greate≈øt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, all being of the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Faction. The names of the≈øe <hi>Cardinals</hi> were <hi>Como, Pinelli, Sauli, Camerino, Sfondrato, Iu≈øtinian, S. George, Arrigone, Vi≈øconte, Conti, Burghe≈øe, Sforza, Montalth, Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øe</hi> and <hi>Cefis:</hi> Out of the≈øe he culled Foure, to wit, <hi>Pinelli, Iu≈øtinian, S.

<hi>Cefis,</hi> to be
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:17285:128"/> employed with the <hi>Trea≈øurer</hi> and the
<hi>Commi≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of the <hi>Chamber,</hi> about the meanes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide money. He al≈øo Created eight <hi>Cardinalls</hi> in the middle of
<hi>September,</hi> not without the a≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment of godly Per≈øons, and ≈øuch as reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Antiquity, becau≈øe he had not expected the due time of
<hi>Ember,</hi> which followed but a few dayes after. It is true ≈øometimes the <hi>Popes</hi> vpon ≈øome vrgent con≈øideration, had formerly Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one or two, or three <hi>Cardinalls</hi> out of that Time, when it is farre off, but this was ob≈øerued to be the fir≈øt entire Promotion made out of Time, which had been ≈øea≈øonable the next week following. The≈øe
<hi>Cardinals</hi> newly Created, were the <hi>Nuntio's</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> to the end that they might employ them≈øelues more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou≈øly in his Seruice, by rea≈øon of this Honour which they had receiued, and al≈øo that by this meanes they might haue more credit with tho≈øe <hi>Princes.</hi> Two others were <hi>Caietan</hi> and

<hi>Venice,</hi> as well knowing their humour and di≈øpo≈øition; To the≈øe were ioyned ≈øoure others, <hi>Lanti, Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> of the <hi>Chamber, Montreal, Maffei,</hi> and <hi>Ferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tini,</hi> by who≈øe Promotion fell vacant many

            </p>
            <p>This Promotion in no ≈øort plea≈øed the <hi>Amba≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øadors</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> although this latter had rea≈øon to be content, for the Intere≈øts of his <hi>King;</hi> ≈øince of this whole number of eight, there were at the lea≈øt Six well affected to that <hi>Crowne.</hi> But that which di≈øplea≈øed the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador,</hi> was that his Brother had beene neglected, as al≈øo He of <hi>France</hi> was not well ≈øatisfied, becau≈øe they had not thought vpon <hi>Villeroy</hi> his Father.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> rendered an account of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion vnto the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> by his <hi>Nuntio,</hi> and on this occa≈øion made new in≈øtances to that <hi>King</hi> to be aided again≈øt the
<hi>Republique,</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenting in a violent fa≈øhion (according to his cu≈øtome) the matters treated by <hi>Fre≈øne,</hi> who ≈øaid (as he fained) that at <hi>Venice</hi> the Authority of the <hi>Catholique King</hi> was de≈øpi≈øed, and ≈øo did him no benefit: for the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> (who yet was his Friend, and employed him≈øelfe for him effectually) would take the contrary ≈øide, if he ≈øaw him thus ioyned with
<hi>Spaine.</hi> But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were too well adui≈øed to be ≈øwayed by ≈øuch feeble Rea≈øons.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Venice,</hi> by rea≈øon of this <hi>Congregation</hi> which the <hi>Pope</hi> had erected, the <hi>Senate</hi> now
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:17285:129"/> clearely made an≈øwer to <hi>Cardenas</hi> the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> of <hi>Spaine;</hi> that it was Notorious to all the World, that the <hi>Republique</hi> could not alter their Lawes in any ≈øort, without great detriment to their <hi>E≈øtate;</hi> that it ≈øeemed ≈øtrange to them why they ≈øhould addre≈ø≈øe them≈øelues vnto the
<hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> only, and make Propo≈øitions ≈øo preiudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, while≈øt on the other ≈øide they fomented the preten≈øions of the
<hi>Pope:</hi> that if their end were the repo≈øe of <hi>Italy</hi> and of
<hi>Chri≈øtendome,</hi> they might clearely ≈øee the good affection of the
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi> to that purpo≈øe, and that the contrary ≈øignes appeared manife≈øtly in the <hi>Pope:</hi> that the mo≈øt apparent was the

The <hi>Senate</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo prote≈øted that they had no other end or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ≈øaue only to defend them≈øelues, in which regard if they came to Armes, the Cau≈øe ≈øhould proceed meerely from the <hi>Pope:</hi> Wherefore if the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> de≈øired the Peace, that he ≈øhould labour with the
<hi>Pope,</hi> from whom aro≈øe the beginning and progre≈ø≈øe of all the≈øe Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. They commended likewi≈øe the good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

            <p>The ≈øame time <hi>Mon≈øieur de Fre≈øne</hi> was called by the
<hi>Senate,</hi> with whom they di≈øcour≈øed touching the
<hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>gregation</hi> of War newly erected, and of the <hi>Cardinals</hi> whereof it con≈øi≈øted, who were ill affected to the <hi>Republique</hi> and not well to <hi>France;</hi> wherein the <hi>Pope</hi> had te≈øtified his ≈ømall re≈øpect of the mo≈øt <hi>Chri≈øtian King,</hi> not expecting his an≈øwer, which they could not a≈øcribe to any other cau≈øe but the
<hi>Popes</hi> purpo≈øe to pur≈øue the Troubles, who was confident in the declaration of <hi>Spaine,</hi> not making account of any other, for the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance and forces which he expected from thence. Adioyning, that the
<hi>Senate</hi> would communicate with him in all confidence, as with the
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> of a <hi>King</hi> iu≈øt and their friend: that they were re≈øolued to
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:17285:130"/> doe what they could in their defence, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the iniuries, promi≈øing them≈øelues on the <hi>Kings</hi> part all a≈ø≈øi≈øtance for the common Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. The <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> complained of this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,</hi> and of the qualitie of tho≈øe that were elected, as al≈øo for that the <hi>Pope</hi> had not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the an≈øwer of the <hi>King</hi> as he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed. And becau≈øe he had then receiued an≈øwer from the <hi>King</hi> concerning that which the
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi> had yeelded in gratification to his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie≈øtie,</hi> he gaue them thanks for the Pri≈øoners, and for the other things which they had promi≈øed: yet he ≈øignified that there remained ≈øome doubt in the
<hi>King</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> would hardly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to reuoke his
<hi>Cen≈øures</hi> before the Su≈øpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of the Lawes, ≈øeeing the Lawes had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen occa≈øion to the Publication of the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures;</hi> that his
<hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> had con≈øidered the Rea≈øons of the <hi>Republique</hi> and approued them, and that hee would ≈øerue him≈øelfe thereof in time and place, although he would not conte≈øt with the <hi>Pope;</hi> who hauing ca≈øt him≈øelfe into a precipice by euill coun≈øell, yet would not ≈øee the meanes to recouer him≈øelfe, and therefore often recalled the word which he had once gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and all delay put him in doubt and ≈øu≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:17285:131"/> Wherefore he exhorted them ≈øpeedily to put an end vnto the Difference, which could not be done without ≈øu≈øpending the execution of their Lawes, alledging for rea≈øon that this was nothing but a pure ceremonie, &amp; ≈øhould be done in gratificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of the <hi>King,</hi> not of the <hi>Pope:</hi> That it ≈øhould be done to no other end, then to giue ≈øome pretext vnto the <hi>Pope</hi> to retire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe with honour; and that haply in ≈øo doing there ≈øhould be no ≈øpeech of the Pri≈øoners nor the Prote≈øtation: That the <hi>King</hi> in all this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øted he de≈øired not any whit to preiudice their Liberty and their E≈øtate, as hauing for end only the common good: That hereby they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his intentions to differ from theirs who had reque≈øted the <hi>Pope</hi> to ≈øuffer no Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>po≈øition but by their meanes, the end whereof was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øume both the one part &amp; the other. <hi>Fre≈øne</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned, that when they ≈øhould bee forced to make Warre, the <hi>King</hi> would readily ≈øerue the
<hi>Republique,</hi> if they would communicate with him their De≈øignes as well offen≈øiue as defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiue. Hee demanded al≈øo a≈ø≈øurance, that they would not treat of the Accord but by his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, and by no other meanes, becau≈øe the <hi>King</hi> was not yet certaine that the <hi>Pope</hi> would
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:17285:131"/> ca≈øt him≈øelfe into the armes of
<hi>Spaine:</hi> But if he ≈øhould ≈øee him re≈øolued to breake, he knew well how to re≈øtraine his furie, which he would doe principally for the fauour and good intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence which hee had with the <hi>Republique;</hi> though if he had not ≈øo ≈øtrict an alliance with them, yet he was obliged by rea≈øon of <hi>State</hi> to a≈ø≈øi≈øt them, and oppo≈øe him≈øelfe again≈øt their ruine. Vpon this the <hi>Senate</hi> thought it conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, to procure a confirmation of all this from the <hi>Kings</hi> owne mouth, and therefore comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador Re≈øident</hi> with him to doe all that he could to di≈øcouer the minde of his <hi>Maie≈øtie,</hi> and to draw from him this confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; intreating him that ≈øince the <hi>Pope</hi> relying vpon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and others, did not cea≈øe to Arme, and becau≈øe the times required, his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie≈øtie</hi> would be contented to v≈øe his authoritie to ≈øtop the cour≈øe of the≈øe euils, which if they ≈øhould continue, the <hi>Republique</hi> could not but haue recour≈øe to their true, ancient and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Friends, among whom he was the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall. And when it ≈øhould plea≈øe him confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to communicate with them his intentions, they would ≈øend vnto his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> a Per≈øon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øly to treat of particularities. To this the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:17285:132"/> 
               <hi>King</hi> an≈øwered, that hee had beene de≈øired by the <hi>Nuntio</hi> in the name of the <hi>Pope,</hi> to declare him≈øelfe for his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe;</hi> that he would an≈øwer them in like manner as he had an≈øwered the <hi>Pope,</hi> to wit, that to declare him≈øelfe for either partie wereto foment the Differences, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would not fauour the purpo≈øes of the one ≈øide or the other, as did the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> for their owne aduantage, but if they ≈øhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øturbe the publique tranquillitie, in that ca≈øe he would doe what be≈øeemed him, and as any one might coniecture: but for the pre≈øent they ought not to pre≈ø≈øe ≈øuch Declarations, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øtudie to preuent a rupture for to auoid the incommodities of War, which none can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend but they that haue tried them, e≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally con≈øidering the danger of Religion which Warre importeth. That for the≈øe rea≈øons it was fit to v≈øe all meanes not to interrupt the Treaty, nor to render him incapable to conclude the agreement, as he ≈øhould be if he declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe for the one or the other: that to ≈øend vnto him an expre≈ø≈øe <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> was to render him ≈øu≈øpected vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> and to giue occa≈øion to the

            <p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:17285:132"/> Further, they communicated to the

<hi>Ma≈øter,</hi> and procure the Succours which he promi≈øed; accordingly they gaue order to their <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador Iustinian</hi> to treat with the
<hi>King.</hi> The <hi>Engli≈øh Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> te≈øtified very much contentment to doe this Office, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that it was to publi≈øh the glory of his <hi>King,</hi> which he would doe not onely in <hi>Venice</hi> to all the Mini≈øters of <hi>Princes,</hi> but al≈øo that by his <hi>Letters</hi> he would diuulge the fame thereof thorowout the world. He al≈øo praied them to ≈øignifie vnto him their particular De≈øignes, for that the <hi>King,</hi> Him≈øelfe, and other Mini≈øters of his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> in all places would doe their vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termo≈øt in their behalfe, and ≈øhew their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and open heart. He pa≈ø≈øed further, and ≈øaid, that it was nece≈ø≈øarie to put a ≈øpeedy end to this affaire, which could not be attained but by one of the≈øe three meanes, either by yeelding, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the matter to
<hi>Princes,</hi> or by Warre. That he ≈øaw well the <hi>Republique</hi> had no minde to the fir≈øt; and if they re≈øolued to make a refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to any, they could not make choi≈øe of any
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:17285:133"/> fitter then his <hi>King,</hi> who maruellou≈øly well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood how much it imported to maintaine the Authoritie giuen by <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Princes.</hi> But if the matter ≈øhould come to Armes, he praied his <hi>Serenitie</hi> to con≈øider that though <hi>Philo≈øophers</hi> ≈øay, the <hi>Sunne</hi> warmes the≈øe inferiour bodies without heat in it ≈øelfe, yet in humane things it is not ≈øo; but he that would heat others in his fauour mu≈øt fir≈øt be hot him≈øelfe.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, the <hi>Senate</hi> determined to ≈øignifie vnto all
<hi>Princes</hi> the Declaration of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> But the <hi>King</hi> vpon the Repre≈øentation of the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador Iu≈øtinian,</hi> an≈øwered, That he called <hi>God</hi> to witne≈ø≈øe, his re≈øolution to defend the Cau≈øe of the <hi>Republique,</hi> had no other end but the Seruice of <hi>God,</hi> and to con≈øerue the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty giuen by

<hi>Popes</hi> Spirit with Vanity, to cary Him into a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice, but that He would execute with courage and ≈øinceritie what He had promi≈øed. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered al≈øo as a thing of great importance, that the <hi>Pope</hi> prepared him≈øelfe for the Warre, and had to this effect erected a
<hi>Congregation</hi> of men Di≈øaffected to the <hi>Republique,</hi> and Dependents of <hi>Spaine.</hi> To which He added, that he would be as ready to performe his Promi≈øe, as to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh his Declaration; and if it might turne to the good of the <hi>Republique,</hi> He would doe it with all po≈ø≈øible Aduantage, doing al≈øo good Offices in their behalfe, with all
<hi>Princes</hi> his Friends and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; as with the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>Denmarke,</hi> and the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> from whom he hoped to draw ≈øome Succour. For the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> and the
<hi>Arch-Duke,</hi> he ≈øaid it was to no purpo≈øe to ≈øpeak vnto them, ≈øeeing that the Former had declared him≈øelfe for the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the Latter depended vpon the former: that for <hi>France</hi> it was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary, becau≈øe <hi>Spaine</hi> being for the <hi>Pope,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houed that <hi>King</hi> more than others to con≈øider it, and to fore≈øee the enterpri≈øes which might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øue again≈øt his <hi>Kingdome,</hi> ≈øo as formerly he had
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:17285:134"/> experience: that if he beleeued the Defence of the <hi>Church</hi> to appertaine vnto him, by rea≈øon of his Title of
<hi>Mo≈øt Chri≈øtian,</hi> he might well know that the <hi>Church</hi> herein was not endangered, but the Cau≈øe in common touched the Libertie of
<hi>Princes,</hi> by whom the <hi>Church</hi> was to be Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and Maintained. For conclu≈øion, He ≈øaid, that Hee would doe more by effects than in words. And accordingly he executed all that he had promi≈øed, Signifying by the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury</hi> vnto the
<hi>Mini≈øters</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> which were with him, the re≈øolution which he had taken to A≈ø≈øi≈øt the <hi>Republique,</hi> and writing al≈øo as much vnto the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> and other his Friends.</p>
            <p>While≈øt the≈øe things were thus treated with <hi>Kings,</hi> and by them with the <hi>Pope,</hi> the great <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Tu≈øcany</hi> iudged that it would be an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on worthy of his great Experience, if he a≈ø≈øayed to fini≈øh that which was ≈øo difficult to two ≈øo great
<hi>Kings.</hi> Wherefore euery weeke almo≈øt he ≈øpake thereof to <hi>Robert Lio,</hi> Re≈øident with him; and cau≈øed his Re≈øident <hi>Montagu</hi> in like manner to ≈øpeake at <hi>Venice,</hi> exhorting them to Peace and Concord for the good of <hi>Italy,</hi> and offering him≈øelfe to become the
<hi>Mediator.</hi> To
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:17285:134"/> which they alwaies an≈øwered with thankes, and with this conclu≈øion, that he ≈øhould addre≈ø≈øe him≈øelfe rather to the <hi>Pope,</hi> ≈øince the <hi>Republique</hi> had ≈øo farre conde≈øcended, that the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> had thanked them. But the great <hi>Duke</hi> was not content with this An≈øwer, which gaue no occa≈øion for him to draw the affaire to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe; and therefore he complained with great dexteritie, that he had profitably imployed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe both with the <hi>Pope,</hi> and with the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> without any corre≈øpondence on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe: on the contrary, that on both ≈øides he had receiued ≈øuch words, which if hee had repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they had beene ≈øufficient to trouble all the affaire, and to cut off hope of a Conclu≈øion. That his meaning was not to giue coun≈øell vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Senate,</hi> knowing well their prudence, much le≈ø≈øe to enterpri≈øe to Treat with the preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of other greater <hi>Princes,</hi> but to ioyne with them for the Seruice of <hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>Chri≈øtendome:</hi> That he would therefore aduerti≈øe the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> of all that the <hi>Pope</hi> had ≈øaid in the la≈øt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador,</hi> which was, that his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> could not, nor would con≈øent vnto the Conditions propo≈øed by the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> in as much as it ≈øhould be to him a
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:17285:135"/> great preiudice to receiue the
<hi>Republique</hi> to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour by the hands of any <hi>King,</hi> being him≈øelfe the Spirituall Head of the <hi>Church,</hi> to whom it is not ≈øitting to receiue his Subiects at the hand of another: and ≈øo much the more, becau≈øe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in any difficult betweene the <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øtical Court</hi> and the <hi>Secular,</hi> the Iudgement thereof pertaineth to the
<hi>Eccle≈øia≈øticall,</hi> as to the more worthy. That the <hi>Pope</hi> further ≈øaid, that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Pri≈øoners by the hands of the
<hi>King,</hi> was to goe backward, becau≈øe ≈øome <hi>Venetian Prelats</hi> which were then at <hi>Rome,</hi> had a≈ø≈øured him that the
<hi>Republique</hi> would willingly deliuer them to him≈øelfe; That therfore he was re≈øolued not to Su≈øpend the Excommunication before the Pri≈øoners were deliuered, and the Writings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked which had beene publi≈øhed in fauour of the <hi>Republique:</hi> that afterwards hee would be content the Differences remaining might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined at <hi>Rome</hi> by a

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:17285:135"/> formerly conde≈øcended to an Accord by a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall Su≈øpen≈øion, of his <hi>Monitory,</hi> and of the Lawes of the
<hi>Republique,</hi> yet he could not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute this Accord, becau≈øe it was not approued by the <hi>Cardinalls;</hi> That the <hi>Mo≈øt Chri≈øtian King</hi> had ≈øignified vnto him, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> ought to accept this Condition, but for him≈øelfe, he was not obliged: That if the
<hi>Venetians</hi> had the aid of <hi>Heretiques,</hi> he would haue on his part more <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> than men beleeued. That the great <hi>Duke</hi> ≈øignified the≈øe particularities to the <hi>Republique,</hi> to let them ≈øee that there could be no wor≈øe re≈øolution than that which enclined them to Warre again≈øt the <hi>Pope,</hi> which mu≈øt needs be to their damage; for as much as who≈øoeuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends in that kinde with him may lo≈øe much, but gaine nothing which it ≈øhall not be meet doubly to re≈øtore. That Warre is profitable to none, e≈øpecially not to them who finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues in good e≈øtate, ≈øeeing it produces alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ea≈øily men pa≈ø≈øe therein from better to wor≈øe with little hope of returning. That if the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> treated in this Bu≈øine≈ø≈øe with great zeale for the good of the <hi>Republique,</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe would not be inferiour to him in a good de≈øire to procure the ≈øame, being their Friend,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:17285:136"/> an <hi>Italian Prince,</hi> and a good man: That they ought not to doubt, but if the Warre proceeded, the <hi>Pope</hi> would be a≈ø≈øi≈øted by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and others; and therefore to auoid the Troubles of <hi>Italy,</hi> which might follow, he would per≈øwade the <hi>Pope</hi> to be contented that all Differences might be referred to the iudgement of the Two <hi>Kings,</hi> and de≈øired the <hi>Republique</hi> to doe the ≈øame; yea that he would coun≈øell them to doe this, not expecting the <hi>Popes</hi> a≈ø≈øent, con≈øidering that ≈øince it was certaine the
<hi>Pope</hi> would not con≈øent to this motion, becau≈øe it was to ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him≈øelfe to the iudgement of another, the <hi>Republique</hi> hereby might gaine ≈øome aduantage by putting the <hi>Pope</hi> in diffidence with the≈øe
<hi>Kings,</hi> and by taking away the courage of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for his a≈ø≈øi≈øtance. And although the <hi>Pope</hi> ≈øhould con≈øent, yet the <hi>Republique</hi> might be a≈ø≈øured, that the <hi>Kings</hi> in the deci≈øion would haue re≈øpect to their owne Intere≈øts, which were the ≈øame with tho≈øe of the <hi>Republique.</hi> That of this Propo≈øition were not admitted, then be had another peraduenture ≈øome what more difficult, but which would certainly better ≈øucceed, if they would make ≈øome ≈ømall Expences; which it behoued them not to reiect, for as much
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:17285:136"/> as a ≈øea≈øonable Expence is ordinarily very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall. That hee knew well what hee ≈øaid, hauing a great Friend in
<hi>Court,</hi> the <hi>Lord Iohn Bapti≈øt Borghe≈øe,</hi> the <hi>Popes</hi> Brother; that if they would giue way, with a little ≈øiluer hee would a≈ø≈øuredly bring the Controuer≈øie to a good agreement. To the≈øe Propo≈øuious the <hi>Senate</hi> an≈øwered, after they had thanked the great
<hi>Duke</hi> for the communication of all that which he knew from
<hi>Rome,</hi> as al≈øo for his good Offices, Coun≈øels and Di≈øcour≈øes; that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of the <hi>Republique</hi> to Peace was knowne to all the World, in which they purpo≈øed ≈øtill to continue, prouided that they were not con≈øtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to doe otherwi≈øe: al≈øo they had giuen hereof good Te≈øtimony, ≈øeeing that not hauing no regard to Offences receiued, &amp; to the iu≈øtice of their Cau≈øe, which required that Iniuries ≈øhould be thorowly repaied, before they gaue care to any Conditions of Peace; they had not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding not only kept open the way vnto The Treaty, and harkned to the Propo≈øitions which had beene made, but had further yeelded ≈øo far as they were able at the in≈øtance of the Two <hi>Kings.</hi> And although they had done ≈øo much, and that the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> was not
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:17285:137"/> onely fully ≈øatisfied touching their actions, but had al≈øo ≈øent expre≈øly to thanke them, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthele≈ø≈øe they could not yet ≈øee any effect of the Treaty of that
<hi>King</hi> with the <hi>Pope;</hi> and therefore the <hi>Republique</hi> was obliged to ≈øtand to that which they had treated with the <hi>King,</hi> and expected what his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> would doe in the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, iudging it not fit to interrupt the treaty which hee had enterpri≈øed: but in the meane while, that they would ≈øay confidently, there were many and vnauoidable difficulties in tho≈øe things which the <hi>Pope</hi> had ≈øignified vnto him by his <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador.</hi> For touching the point of the
<hi>Pri≈øoners,</hi> hauing giuen them vnto the <hi>King,</hi> they had no more to doe in them, nor was it in them now to take any other re≈øolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And for that which concerned the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, tho≈øe of <hi>Rome</hi> being fir≈øt publi≈øhed, and full of iniuries, reuilings and calumnies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they were of nece≈ø≈øity to make an≈øwer with mode≈øtie, it was not meet to vrge them, if they did not fir≈øt of all, or at lea≈øt at the ≈øame time, vrge again≈øt tho≈øe of <hi>Rome.</hi> For the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi> to which the <hi>Pope</hi> would remit the affaire, it was not needfull to ≈øay much, the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi> being not accu≈øtomed to refer vnto the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:17285:137"/> deci≈øion of another, ≈øuch things as coucerne their Gouernment. And for the other Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitions of his
<hi>Highne≈ø≈øe,</hi> ≈øince that the <hi>Popes</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhion of proceeding gaue iu≈øt ≈øu≈øpition that he was not di≈øpo≈øed vnto Peace, they could not examine them, vnle≈ø≈øe they had greater certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his intentions: and ≈øeeing all former Treaties had produced no good effect, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of the <hi>Popes</hi> incon≈øtancie well knowne to his
<hi>Highne≈ø≈øe,</hi> the <hi>Republique</hi> ≈øaw clearely it was to no purpo≈øe to harken to any further propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitions, or to oblige them≈øelues by their word in any points without a reciprocall a≈ø≈øurance on his behalfe. But when (after the remouing of the <hi>Cen≈øures)</hi> they ≈øhould ≈øee any appearance of an amicable temperame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t, which might efface the iu≈øt apprehen≈øions which they had of his ordinarie incon≈øtancie, they would con≈øider thereof adui≈øedly, and end all with re≈øolution; that which could not be done ≈øo long as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were handled by di≈øcour≈øe. To this an≈øwer made by the <hi>Re≈øident</hi> in the name of the <hi>Senate,</hi> the great <hi>Duke</hi> replied, that the <hi>Pope</hi> was not ill affected, although haply ≈øome accidents had troubled him, which he could affirme out of his certaine knowledge: and that although he
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:17285:138"/> ≈øeemed to be altered, yet when his
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> did repre≈øent vnto him the things afore≈øaid, he confirmed them; and he adioyned, that he had cau≈øed many Propo≈øitions to be made to the <hi>Republique,</hi> and yet could not preuaile to know their intentions: That it was meet to vnder≈øtand the one the other; That treaties prepare the way to conclu≈øions, and that if they ≈øhould tru≈øt him with any thing he would make v≈øe thereof to the aduantage of the
<hi>Republique,</hi> his purpo≈øe being not to di≈øcouer all at once vnto the
<hi>Pope</hi> which he had to tell him, but to re≈øerue a part to ≈øerue him≈øelfe thereof as occa≈øion required, not meaning to doe as others, who had not drawne from the <hi>Pope</hi> any re≈øolution, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had propo≈øed many things to his aduantage.</p>
            <p>The interpo≈øing of ≈øo many <hi>Princes</hi> for the according of the≈øe Differences, moued al≈øo the <hi>Emperour</hi> to haue his part therein: and to this effect, he ≈øent in the beginning of <hi>October</hi> his
<hi>Vice-Chancelor</hi> named <hi>Coraducci,</hi> to the
<hi>Amba≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øador</hi> of the <hi>Repub. Soranzo, Re≈øident</hi> with him, for to tell him, that his <hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> vnder≈øtanding that the Differences betweene the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Republique</hi> were ≈øo far pa≈ø≈øed, that the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:17285:138"/> thereof was very difficult, e≈øpecially ≈øince the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> ≈øeemed ready to for≈øake the Treaty, Him≈øelfe was once purpo≈øed for the good of <hi>Chri≈øtendome</hi> (which he pa≈ø≈øionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly de≈øired,) to employ him≈øelfe for the ≈øetling of a Peace betweene the two parties, if he had thought that his trauell herein would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and that he might performe it with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: but ≈øince both of them were ≈øo re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute not to yeeld any thing the one to the other, he could not hazard therein his dignity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. <hi>Soranzo</hi> an≈øwered, after he had thanked his <hi>Maie≈øtie;</hi> that the
<hi>Republique</hi> was ready to doe all they could po≈ø≈øibly to preuent the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the publique Tranquillitie, ≈øauing euer their Liberty, their Dignity, and the Intere≈øts of their <hi>E≈øtate:</hi> but that the
<hi>Pope</hi> would needs carry all, and pretended that all ought to yeeld vnto his Will without any demurre or conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtation. The <hi>Vice-Chancellor,</hi> after ≈øome Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øes vpon the Points, replied, that the

<hi>Marqui≈øe</hi> of <hi>Ca≈øtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> with good in≈øtructions. After this the <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> did
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:17285:139"/> all they could to cau≈øe the <hi>Emp.</hi> to decalre him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe for the <hi>Pope;</hi> to whom the <hi>Emperor</hi> freely an≈øwered, That He thought not fit to declare him≈øelfe for either part, or to make ≈øuch offers as ≈øome had made by Letters and other ≈øuch Apparences, this tending to countenance and incourage very exorbitant Preten≈øions; That He wi≈øhed Peace might be e≈øtabli≈øhed in any ca≈øe, and being re≈øolued to bend him≈øelfe this way, he would not do a thing whereby Peace might be hindered. And in priuate, he gaue the <hi>Amba≈øs.</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> to vnder≈øtand, that for the publique quiet of
<hi>Chri≈øtendome,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> his Ma≈øter ought to mortifie in ≈øome ≈øort the <hi>Pope,</hi> to the end that being reduced to Rea≈øon, hee might more ea≈øily admit the Peace. The≈øe things when the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador Soranzo</hi> had writ to <hi>Venice,</hi> he had charge to thanke the
<hi>Emp.</hi> and to certifie him of their inclination to Peace, and further to tell Him, that the <hi>Senate</hi> would e≈øteeme it a great Honour, if his
<hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> would be plea≈øed to induce the <hi>Pope</hi> to content him≈øelfe with tho≈øe offers which they had made by the means and in con≈øideration of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France.</hi>

<hi>Republique,</hi> to take away his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures. And in like manner, that they would ≈øend an <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador,</hi> who, according as the

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:17285:142"/> be for them indeed a cold Aduocate, becau≈øe they cannot deny but they haue committed a great error in di≈øobeying their
<hi>Prince</hi> contrary to the Commandement of <hi>God,</hi> and ≈øeeing it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth them e≈øpecially to Preach Obedience ≈øo ≈øtraitly enioyned by
<hi>God.</hi> Be≈øides that hauing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned their Country, wherin they were wel treated and entertained, their ingratitude herein is ≈øo intollerable, that if it belonged to me, I ≈øhould cau≈øe them to be decimated for example vnto others. He added, That the facility of the <hi>Republique</hi> was very great, in that they con≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that their <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> might Treat of their Matter with his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe.</hi> And concluded his Di≈øcour≈øe, by giuing thankes in the Name of his <hi>King,</hi> for that which they had done to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, a≈ø≈øuring them that he would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their good di≈øpo≈øition to publique. Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie, hauing in truth done as much as was conuenient.</p>
            <p>While≈øt the≈øe things were thus treated, the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> receiued aduice of the <hi>Popes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con≈øtancy, &amp; of the great <hi>Dukes</hi> practi≈øes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpo≈øe him≈øelfe in the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, to whom the <hi>Pope</hi> gaue care: whereupon he was di≈øplea≈øed both with the great <hi>Duke</hi> for medling in his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:17285:142"/> and al≈øo with the <hi>Pope,</hi> commanding his <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> to make complaint vnto him, and to ≈øhew him that he had but little confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe.</hi> And the
<hi>King</hi> made the ≈øame complaint vnto <hi>Cardinall Barberino,</hi> the
<hi>Popes Nuntio,</hi> Re≈øident with him; and by <hi>Fre≈øne</hi> he told them at <hi>Venice,</hi> That he thanked the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> for that they had pa≈ø≈øed their word not to conclude the Affaire by the Mediation of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but of him, although the <hi>Popes</hi> incon≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie con≈øtrained him to permit, that his <hi>Serenitie</hi> might endeuour to doe by other meanes what he could. But when <hi>Alincourt</hi> had ≈øignified vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the
<hi>Pope</hi> the commandement of the <hi>King,</hi> which was, that his
<hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> had charged him not to meddle further in the Affaire of
<hi>Venice,</hi> ≈øeeing his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> imagined he could better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate the Bu≈øine≈ø≈øe by the Mediation of others: the <hi>Pope</hi> who was already aduerti≈øed by <hi>Letters</hi> from <hi>Cardinall Barberino,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for his an≈øwer, excu≈øed him≈øelfe, that he could not hinder the zeale which ≈øome Others might haue to determine this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and much le≈ø≈øe v≈øe inciuility by refu≈øing their offers: but that notwith≈øtanding he had alwaies great confidence in his
<hi>Maie≈øtie,</hi> and his De≈øigne was
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:17285:143"/> that all might be done by his hand: and he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with many oathes often repeated, that his intention was very good, and that he wi≈øhed the Bu≈øine≈ø≈øe might be ended that very houre, if it were po≈ø≈øible, and that not any other be≈øides the <hi>King</hi> might haue part therein. And to ≈øhew by effects the truth of that which he ≈øaid, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned, that he would be content with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions propo≈øed by his
<hi>Maie≈øtie,</hi> and would firmely hold the word which he had giuen, to erect a <hi>Congregation</hi> of Six <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and ≈øo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Auditors,</hi> among whom he would put the <hi>Cardinals Delfin, Mantica,</hi> and <hi>Seraphin,</hi> and for <hi>Auditors, Cuccina,</hi> and
<hi>Marquemont. Alincourt</hi> here much maruailing, replied, That no ≈øuch thing had beene formerly ≈øpoken off: But the <hi>Pope</hi> affirming the contrary, the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈øtly ≈øaid, That he had not ≈øo vnder≈øtood it; and that it was certaine, the <hi>Republique</hi> was re≈øolued not to referre them≈øelues to any <hi>Congregation</hi> After many Replies on either Part, the <hi>Pope</hi> was content to giue his word, that no more ≈øhould be ≈øpoken of a <hi>Congregation;</hi> and then he di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øed on the other Conditions, hauing fir≈øt prayed
<hi>Alincourt,</hi> for the loue of <hi>God</hi> to keepe all ≈øecret, for as much as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ob≈øerued all
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:17285:143"/> that was treated, to di≈øturbe it. He promi≈øed to take away the Cen≈øures, prouided that in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change the
<hi>Republique</hi> ≈øhould giue a≈ø≈øurance to execute the≈øe Conditions; That the Pri≈øoners ≈øhould be con≈øigned into the hands of a
<hi>Prelate,</hi> whom he ≈øhould name; That an <hi>Amba≈ø≈øadour</hi> ≈øhould come to demand that the Cen≈øures might be remoued, who ≈øhould pre≈øent him≈øelfe with <hi>Alincourt,</hi> with promi≈øe that he ≈øhould be well treated and receiued; That on the day appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted they ≈øhould reuoke the Prote≈øtation, with all that thereupon had followed; That the
<hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> ≈øhould be recalled; and that he might haue a≈ø≈øurance of the <hi>King,</hi> that while≈øt the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> ≈øhould Treat with him, the Lawes ≈øhould not be executed: Adding, that what≈øoeuer he did herein, was for no other Rea≈øon, but for the Dignity of the <hi>See Apo≈øtolique,</hi> &amp; for his charge. And here he inlarged him≈øelfe with vehement words and ge≈øtures to per≈øwade the≈øe Propo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, adioyning notwith≈øtanding, that he was not certain whether He could in
<hi>Con≈øi≈øtory</hi> draw all the <hi>Cardinals</hi> to his opinion.
<hi>Alincourt</hi> replied, that for the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> to be ≈øent, no ≈øuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition had beene propo≈øed. The <hi>Pope</hi> ≈øaid, that otherwi≈øe he could doe nothing, this tending to
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:17285:144"/> con≈øerue his reputation, and to ≈øhew the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of the Excommunication. <hi>Alincourt</hi> made an≈øwer, that rea≈øon concluded the contrary, in as much as the receiuing of an
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> with Honour and v≈øual complements, rather implied the inualidity of the Excommunication. But for all that he could ≈øay as well vpon this point as others, he could nothing preuaile; for the <hi>Pope</hi> concluded, that thus he ≈øhould write to <hi>Fre≈øne,</hi> and no otherwi≈øe. Who reporting the≈øe words vnto the <hi>Senate,</hi> added, That in this point hee would not per≈øwade them to one thing or to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but only demanded that he might haue their an≈øwer.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> immediatly with vehemency com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that in ≈øtead of approaching to an end by the≈øe Treaties, things were further off, the Differences being imbittered by this alteration of minds: ≈øince that the
<hi>Pope</hi> being not willing to hold his word, which he had giuen, this was openly to declare that he would either do thus, or carry all; That it was little for the credit of ≈øo great a <hi>King,</hi> to intermeddle in this Affaire, ≈øince the word once giuen him was reuoked: Wherefore that it was not meet to labour any more, for it was nothing but vainly to ≈øpend
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:17285:144"/> time, ≈øeeing that to yeeld that which the
<hi>Pope</hi> Propo≈øed, was indeed to yeeld all the Cau≈øe, which if they had beene willing to doe, they could haue done it without any mediation of any Per≈øon. But the <hi>Senate</hi> to ≈øatisfie the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance of the
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador,</hi> made him an≈øwer, that with a≈øtoni≈øhment they vnder≈øtood the change of the Propo≈øitions, and that thereby it was ea≈øie to ≈øee that the intention of the <hi>Pope</hi> was not ≈øuch as hee would make the world beleeue, ≈øince the new Propo≈øitions were full of contrarieties and in≈øuperable difficulties. Touching the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoners, that they could render them to ≈øatisfie the <hi>King,</hi> as a thing already accepted by his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ie≈øtie</hi> and him≈øelfe, neuerthele≈ø≈øe with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that it ≈øhould be without preiudice; but that they could not con≈øent to any of the other Propo≈øitions, as being perillous and contrary to their Gouernment; That to ≈øend before an <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈ø≈øador,</hi> were to publi≈øh to all the World that they had erred, and that the Excommunication was iu≈øt, as contrarily to condemne of iniu≈øtice all that which the
<hi>Republique</hi> had done in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their innocency: that to recall at the ≈øame time the <hi>Religious,</hi> ≈øhould be to make them triumph for an action of di≈øobedience, and for
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:17285:145"/> abandoning their Countrey, it being ≈øufficient to remit this Matter to be treated by their
<hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈ø≈øador</hi> with his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe,</hi> on this particular ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great occurrences being to be con≈øidered; That to demand a≈ø≈øurance of the <hi>King,</hi> that the Lawes ≈øhould not be executed, was a thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iu≈øt, and no le≈ø≈øe preiudiciall to his <hi>Maie≈øty,</hi> than to the
<hi>Republique,</hi> who were re≈øolued to execute their Lawes, and further clearely ≈øaid, that they would not giue care to any Su≈øpen≈øion or altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them in any part. For when the World ≈øhould ≈øee them executed, after the <hi>King</hi> had contrarily pa≈ø≈øed his word, Men would haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion to beleeue, either that the <hi>Republique</hi> had failed in their Promi≈øe vnto the <hi>King,</hi> or that he had bin moued too lightly, and without ground to oblige his word. The <hi>Senate</hi> ≈øaid further, that without doubt the <hi>K.</hi> would not take in good part this alteration, which implied little re≈øpect vnto his <hi>Maie≈øtie,</hi> in who≈øe regard the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> had conde≈øcended as farre as they might: And although this manner of proceeding by the <hi>Pope</hi> might (and happily ought) induce the <hi>Republique</hi> to retract all which hitherto they had accorded, notwith≈øtanding to make it appeare that on their part they had not failed to doe all
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:17285:145"/> that was po≈ø≈øible to preuent the trouble and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet of <hi>Chri≈øtendome,</hi> they had a good purpo≈øe to continue in their good di≈øpo≈øition to an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, and con≈øtantly to ≈øtand by their word already giuen, notwith≈øtanding the incon≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the <hi>Pope,</hi> who if he would not yeeld to rea≈øon, yet the
<hi>Senate</hi> hoped to haue ≈øtill good intelligence with his
<hi>Maie≈øtie;</hi> for as much as they had te≈øtified the great e≈øteeme which they made of his Mediation, for that they had in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration of him remitted many of their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øts. At the ≈øame time al≈øo the
<hi>Senate</hi> gaue the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> to vnder≈øtand, that vpon his reque≈øt all Pre≈ø≈øes at <hi>Venice</hi> had beene ≈øtayed, and order giuen that no Bookes vpon this Difference ≈øhould be imprinted: That neuerthele≈ø≈øe from <hi>Rome</hi> and el≈øewhere came forth many Libels in behalfe of the <hi>Pope,</hi> that the Treati≈øes written in fauour of the
<hi>Republique</hi> were condemned, the Authours and Printers proceeded again≈øt by Cen≈øures, and other vndue cour≈øes: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they ≈øhould be con≈øtrained, by way of nece≈ø≈øary defence, to giue libertie vnto their Printers, as before, to the end that their iu≈øt Rea≈øons might bee made knowne to all the World.</p>

<hi>Chri≈øtendome</hi> again≈øt the power of the <hi>Turkes.</hi> And for his owne Per≈øon, hee prote≈øted that he was not come to v≈øe Deceit, being noble by Birth, and therefore obliged to ≈øpeake Truth aboue all things. Touching the ≈øecond, the point of Treaty was for Peace, a thing excellent, and for an Vnion with the <hi>See Apo≈øtolique,</hi> a thing very
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:17285:148"/> profitable to the <hi>Republique,</hi> all Hi≈øtories being full of the mutuall good offices which they haue euer rendered the one to the other; as on the contrary, their Di≈øunion mu≈øt needs be very pernicious to the <hi>Repub.</hi> for if their cau≈øe were vniu≈øt, it would incen≈øe all <hi>Princes</hi> again≈øt them, and though it were rea≈øonable, yet was it not fit therefore to forget what Reuerence men owe to the Soueraigne <hi>Bi≈øhop.</hi> Touching the third, that the Treaty here was with a <hi>Senate</hi> of great Prudence, Louers of Peace, enemies of Nouelty, who had beene alwaies Authors of Tranquillitie in <hi>Italie,</hi> not of any Troubles. He di≈øcour≈øed further of the damages of War, and the mi≈øchiefes of Here≈øies, ≈øaying, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Republique</hi> by their owne ≈øtrength and greatne≈ø≈øe could ≈øu≈øtaine all ≈øorts of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and were able to with≈øtand ≈øufficiently all that ≈øhould a≈ø≈øault them, neuerthele≈ø≈øe other ≈øuccours (although not expected or de≈øired) would vncalled offer them≈øelues, and ≈øuch, as might be ≈øu≈øpected, hand to di≈ømi≈ø≈øe, and ≈øo much more hurtfull as
<hi>Italy</hi> was in good e≈øtate, whence might ari≈øe many corruptions which might put their Gouernment in great danger. As the≈øe things were con≈øiderable, ≈øo the <hi>King</hi>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:17285:149"/> his Ma≈øter accordingly had beene willing to aduerti≈øe them thereof, for the affection which He and his Aunce≈øtors euer haue had to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique,</hi> and for that all are commonly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈ø≈øed in the Peace of <hi>Italie:</hi> and he praied them to referre all matters to ≈øome Arbiters, Him≈øelfe and others: That the <hi>King</hi> did thinke him≈øelfe obliged by way of gratitude to interpo≈øe in this affaire, as remembring that ≈øometime the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi> had interpo≈øed to accommodate ≈øome Differences betweene the <hi>Emperour</hi> his Grand Father and the <hi>King</hi> his Father, and the <hi>Pope.</hi> That it was very nece≈ø≈øarie for <hi>Princes</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their reputation, but yet they ought not to deale too rigorou≈øly with the <hi>Pope<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>

            <p>

And if he ≈øhould re≈øolue to write that he might receiue order to this effect; it would be a thing too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and no way proportionable to the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire which required ≈øpeedy re≈øolution, &amp; which with Time would grow wor≈øe and wor≈øe. That he was a Stranger in the Bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and therefore
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:17285:151"/> not to be remembred of what was pa≈øt, but when the <hi>Senate</hi> would declare their wil to him with confidence, he would effectually propo≈øe it, and cau≈øe it to be accepted.</p>
            <p>To this the <hi>Duke</hi> immediatly an≈øwered, that when the
<hi>Senate</hi> ≈øhould vnder≈øtand what the <hi>Pope</hi> de≈øired, they could Treat and make decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their will; but the way being ≈øhut vp by rea≈øon of the <hi>Interdict,</hi> if that were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, no good Treaty could po≈ø≈øibly be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered. Therefore ≈øince he de≈øired to know the intention of the <hi>Republique,</hi> that this it was, to wit, that all things might be ree≈øtabli≈øhed in that e≈øtate wherein they were before the
<hi>Monitorie</hi> publi≈øhed, and that the <hi>Pope</hi> would Treat with them, as a Father with his Children, ≈øo as he was obliged, which if he had done, all men had been freed from all the≈øe Troubles. Here <hi>D. Francis</hi> ≈øaid, that this Propo≈øition to re≈øtore all things to their fir≈øt e≈øtate, would be diuer≈øly interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becau≈øe the
<hi>Republique</hi> vnder≈øtood it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Cen≈øures,</hi> and the
<hi>Pope</hi> without doubt would take it, for the Time going before the Lawes. Whereunto the <hi>Duke</hi> replied, ≈øaying, That it ≈øufficed to bring matters into ≈øuch ca≈øe, that the Treaty might be as betweene the Father and

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:17285:151"/> the Sons, and that then by means of the Treatie other things might ea≈øily be accommodated, as they had beene ere then, if the <hi>Pope</hi> had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpoiled him≈øelfe of the quality of a Father, and taken that of an Enemy. And though all were brought backe to that e≈øtate wherein they were before the Promulgation of the Laws, yet things had beene then more ea≈øie to accord, becau≈øe they ≈øhould haue had to doe with a <hi>Clement</hi> 8. or a <hi>Leo</hi> 11 who had not occa≈øioned the≈øe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, as they did not any, although the Lawes in their time for the greater part were publi≈øhed: tho≈øe <hi>Popes</hi> knowing right well what was the Authority of a <hi>Prince,</hi> free and independant, and not mingling them≈øelues in any fa≈øhion in the Gouernment of another. The
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> then concluded, that hee would make the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and to that effect employ him≈øelfe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Senate</hi> con≈øidered that it was not meet to giue an ab≈øolute repul≈øe to an <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador,</hi> ≈øent expre≈øly from ≈øo great a <hi>King,</hi> and for this particular Affaire; al≈øo that it ≈øhould be inciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, if they did not communicate with him that which they had yeelded in Fauour of the <hi>Mo≈øt Chri≈øtian King,</hi> and which might giue him occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:17285:152"/> to retire him≈øelfe with di≈øcontent, ≈øeeing the ≈ømall care they had to corre≈øpond vnto the good Offices by him done, a thing which might be of ill con≈øequence. Wherefore they determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to communicate all vnto him, fir≈øt aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing <hi>Fre≈øne</hi> hereof, and giuing him to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand that this ≈øhould not hinder the progre≈ø≈øe of the Treaty begun by the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Ma≈øter,</hi> for as much as
<hi>Don Francis de Ca≈øtro</hi> had clearely ≈øaid, that he would not plucke the Treaty out of his hands; and although he had the ≈øame De≈øigne, yet the Accord would be acknowledged en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely from his <hi>King.</hi> But
<hi>Fre≈øne</hi> vnder≈øtanding the intention of the <hi>Senate,</hi> was not only well plea≈øed with this communication, but further ≈øaid, That he e≈øteemed it nece≈ø≈øary, it being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that the <hi>Pope</hi> would communicate all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and therefore if they ≈øhould conceale what had pa≈ø≈øed, it might giue occa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of diffidence; That for this rea≈øon they might a≈ø≈øure them≈øelues, the <hi>King</hi> would re≈øt content. To which he added, that the <hi>Pope</hi> had intreated him by
<hi>Alincourt,</hi> to be willing to ioyne his Offices with tho≈øe of <hi>Don Francis de Ca≈øtro;</hi> wherein he knew not what the <hi>Pope</hi> intended, or whereat he aimed, and therefore had written
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:17285:152"/> that his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> would further declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe; becau≈øe if his meaning were, that what his

            <p>
               <hi>Don Francis de Ca≈øtro</hi> being then called into the
<hi>Senate</hi> before the <hi>Duke,</hi> they read vnto him all that had pa≈ø≈øed vntill that day, together with that which the <hi>Pope</hi> had required of the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> and what they had yeelded in Fauour of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> Which when he had heard, he thanked the
<hi>Senate</hi> for this Communication, and for the confidence they had in him, adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, That for further corre≈øpondence and to breake the ice, which already began to melt, he would propo≈øe a meane which to him ≈øeemed very proper ≈øpeedily to end the≈øe Controuer≈øies, which ≈øhould not be any of tho≈øe things which the <hi>Senate</hi> had iu≈øtly rejected, whereof it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:17285:153"/> to ≈øpeake. And therefore ommitting the reuocation or Su≈øpen≈øion of their Lawes indeed preiudiciall to their Liberty, he would Propo≈øe a Su≈øpen≈øion only for a time, of fiue, foure, or three moneths, with Conditions very cleare; That what the
<hi>Republique</hi> did herein, was only to open a way vnto a Treaty, and out of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding de≈øire to the Publique quiet, &amp; by way of Gratification to the Two <hi>Kings;</hi> That by ≈øo doing, the <hi>Republique</hi> ≈øhould be ≈øo farre from receiuing any lo≈ø≈øe or preiudice, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary they ≈øhould gaine a great aduantage, for that their hands ≈øhould not be tyed to enter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into their former e≈øtate, and becau≈øe a <hi>State</hi> ≈øo well founded, and of ≈øuch Antiquitie, could not hereby receiue alteration: That the <hi>Repub.</hi> had conde≈øcended ≈øo far, as that no more could be de≈øired. For, touching the Pri≈øoners, it was very rea≈øonable that they ≈øhould not be rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but with a re≈øeruation of their Rea≈øons; That, being content the <hi>Pope</hi> might be prayed, the
<hi>Republique</hi> therein had te≈øtified their Deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: as al≈øo, to ≈øend an <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> when the <hi>Cen≈øures</hi> were remoued, was a notable te≈øtimony of the good will of the
<hi>Republique</hi> towards the <hi>Pope,</hi> wherewith He ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:17285:153"/> him≈øelfe, and hee beleeued that at la≈øt hee would be therewith ≈øatisfied. But ≈øince all this did not bring matters to a conclu≈øion, (as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared that till then they had concluded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) he therefore propo≈øed this Su≈øpen≈øion for a time, which (as it ≈øeemed to him) could bring no preiudice. And he adioyned, that he would doe his vtmo≈øt endeuour, that an accord might follow; and although the
<hi>Marque≈ø≈øe d'Aiton</hi> was very ≈øufficient to treat this affaire with the <hi>Pope,</hi> notwith≈øtanding, if it did ≈øeeme good to them, that he ≈øhould ≈øend a Gentleman expre≈øly to this end, or that him≈øelfe ≈øhould goe in Per≈øon, hee was readie to doe all that they ≈øhould de≈øire of him, ≈øo vehemently did he long to ≈øee this Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference accommodate.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> an≈øwered him, that he was very ioyfull to ≈øee his <hi>Lord≈øhip</hi> re≈øt ≈øatisfied, and that he acknowledged the ≈øinceritie of the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> together with the Reuerence they had to the <hi>See Apo≈øtolique</hi> in the forme of their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; as al≈øo how fal≈øe it was which their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had divulged, that the <hi>Repub.</hi> purpo≈øed to ≈øeparate them≈øelues from the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Holy See.</hi> That notwith≈øtanding they were ≈øtill min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to pre≈øerue their Liberty, with all that which

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Senate</hi> hauing al≈øo heard the Propo≈øition
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:17285:154"/> of <hi>Don Francis de Ca≈øtro</hi> read, made this an≈øwer; That the Su≈øpen≈øion, as it was propo≈øed, did ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolutely weaken the Power of Gouernment, and therefore they could not po≈ø≈øibly conde≈øcend vnto it: wherefore they were re≈øolued not to giue eare to ≈øuch a Propo≈øition. But ≈øince that which was already yeelded, afforded ample matter for a Treaty, <hi>Don Francis</hi> might ioyne him≈øelfe with the
<hi>French,</hi> and turne him≈øelfe to the <hi>Pope,</hi> who ought to be fully ≈øatisfied with the Conditions by them granted. To which <hi>Don Francis</hi> replied, that his <hi>Ma≈øter</hi> had not ≈øent him to the
<hi>Pope,</hi> but to the <hi>Republique,</hi> and that his iourney ≈øhould be without fruit, becau≈øe the <hi>Pope</hi> would tell him that he brought no newes, and that others had made vnto him the ≈øame Propo≈øition: and that he came to no other end than to per≈øwade him to doe that which he had refu≈øed at the in≈øtance of another; That he could not make this iourney but as from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe, ≈øince he had no charge from the <hi>King</hi> to v≈øe therein his Name, but onely in that which ≈øhould be granted vpon his demand. And here he endeuoured with great efficacie to per≈øwade the Su≈øpen≈øion for a certaine time, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly he propo≈øed, ≈øhewing in the fir≈øt place
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:17285:155"/> that it was a thing which could not bring them any preiudice, for as much as they were not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by any violence vnto it, in which ca≈øe only their Liberty ≈øhould be wronged, but it ≈øhould be a pure Gratification yeelded by good will and that to ≈øu≈øpend for a time, was not to ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend ab≈øolutely, but was a petty thing, and of no con≈øideration. Then arguing from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of him from whom it was propo≈øed, he ≈øaid, the Reputation of that great <hi>King</hi> ≈øhould be much dimini≈øhed, if he could nothing preuaile that he could not demand the Pri≈øoners, con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that they were already yeelded to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> in who≈øe Fauour hauing done this, it was meet to doe as much for his
<hi>King,</hi> and the kindne≈ø≈øe would be equall, if they granted vnto him this Su≈øpen≈øion. Withall <hi>Don Francis</hi> adioyned his owne particular Intere≈øts, ≈øaying That indeed he ≈øaw him≈øelfe welcomed, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with many magnifice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øtrations of Honour, but all this he did not e≈øteeme in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of that Honour which he might haue by according the Di≈ø≈øentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s. For if he obtained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, Men would beleeue that he was ignorant how to Treat, or that he had beene circumuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and ≈øo much more nece≈ø≈øary was it for him

That the ≈øecond Rea≈øon was not of any con≈øideration, to ≈øay that the Su≈øpen≈øion for a time was not any way preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall; it being no good con≈øequence, that it brings no preiudice at all, becau≈øe not ≈øo much as a perpetuall Su≈øpen≈øion: as it followes not that a man is no whit offended becau≈øe hee might be more: al≈øo that the compari≈øon was

               <hi>Republique</hi> had yeelded, fir≈øt for to gratifie the <hi>King</hi> his Ma≈øter, and then in con≈øideration of the

That they were willing to performe what had beene yeelded, vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that the <hi>Cen≈øures</hi> ≈øhould bee reuoked, which the <hi>Pope</hi> not being willing to do, the act of the

<hi>Pope</hi> would ≈øay vnto him, You doe not bring any new thing, for that which you offer was giuen by another: That it was meet to di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øh his
<hi>King</hi> from others, and to doe in his con≈øideration ≈øomething more, ≈øeeing he had ≈øent him expre≈øly, that which others had not done: That if he had not any thing from the <hi>Pope,</hi> the rea≈øon was becau≈øe he came from the <hi>King</hi> his Ma≈øter to the <hi>Republique</hi> to receiue from them and to carry vnto the <hi>Pope</hi> ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which might con≈øerue both the Dignitie of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the Liberty of the

In the end, he prayed them affectionately, to thinke anow vpon that which he had ≈øaid, and to make him an≈øwer. But ≈øeeing they did not an≈øwer him at the pre≈øent, he demanded to haue Audience in the <hi>Dukes</hi> chamber, becau≈øe he hoped to find the <hi>Prince</hi> with le≈ø≈øe a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of <hi>Senators,</hi> and ≈øo to di≈øcour≈øe more familiarly with him, or becau≈øe he beleeued he might ≈øay ≈øome what more proper for the Affaire in the ab≈øence of <hi>Don Innigo de Cardenas</hi> the Ordinary <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador,</hi> who greatly ob≈øerued to Treat with reputation conuenient to the dignitie of his <hi>King, Don Francis</hi> therefore being come into the chamber of the <hi>Duke</hi> where the <hi>Senate</hi> were a≈ø≈øembled, accompanied onely by the <hi>Duke de Vietri,</hi> he made in the fir≈øt place a long di≈øcour≈øe of the fauours and honours which he receiued daily from the <hi>Republique,</hi> ≈øuch as the <hi>Duke de Vietri</hi> ≈øaid to be extraordinarie. Then he ≈øaid, that he came into that priuate place to ≈øpeake more freely and without ≈øo many witne≈ø≈øes; and the ≈øub≈øtance of his Di≈øcour≈øe was, That he had now beene three and forty daies in <hi>Venice;</hi> where the people ≈øaid, that he did nothing but
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:17285:159"/> play the ≈ømell-fea≈øt: That he was young, and that the old ones would di≈øpatch him with good words without effects: That as he had a good affection for the ≈øeruice of his <hi>Serenitie,</hi> ≈øo he de≈øired to ≈øee the like on his part recipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally; but the
<hi>Republique</hi> would propo≈øe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor accept that which he had propo≈øed, although the Rea≈øons which he vrged were ≈øo ≈øtrong that they were vnan≈øwerable; as well in concluding, that the Su≈øpen≈øion required was a ≈ømall thing and ea≈øie to be granted, as in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon≈øtrating that ≈øo much being done at the Petition of the <hi>French,</hi> it was fit at lea≈øt to doe a little in gratification of the <hi>Catholique King,</hi> which was no le≈ø≈øe worthy, no le≈ø≈øe friendly; nor le≈ø≈øe officious towards the
<hi>Republique.</hi> And here with much eloquence (wherein verily he excelled) he propo≈øed, repeated, and amplified the ≈øame things, with the ≈øame rea≈øons, making a formall Oration full of ≈øentences &amp; conceits, inlarging principally the argument drawne from the reputation of the
<hi>King</hi> his <hi>Ma≈øter,</hi> of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lerma,</hi> and of Him≈øelfe. To which the <hi>Duke</hi> an≈øwered, and let him ≈øee that he had ample occa≈øion to employ him≈øelfe, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha≈øe reputation by meanes of that which had
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:17285:159"/> beene communicated to him, and expounded more ≈øuccinctly what the <hi>Senate</hi> had ≈øaid, to wit, that <hi>Don Innigo</hi> had beene the fir≈øt who had put the Difference in Treaty, and had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed them to make the two fir≈øt paces. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it could not be ≈øaid that nothing had been done in fauour of <hi>Spaine:</hi> but after <hi>Don Innigo</hi> pa≈ø≈øing no farther, and the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpo≈øing him≈øelfe, this gaue occa≈øion to the <hi>Republique</hi> to goe on ≈øo far, to ≈øhew them≈øelues de≈øirous of, Peace and full of re≈øpect to the <hi>Church</hi> which thing they had al≈øo done at the in≈øtance of the <hi>Catholique King,</hi> if he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his Offices. But although there pa≈ø≈øed many an≈øwers and replies of <hi>Don Francis</hi> and the <hi>Duke de Vietri,</hi> yet in conclu≈øion nothing was determined.</p>
            <p>In the meane while at <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> vpon all occa≈øions continued to make in≈øtance with <hi>Alincourt,</hi> that the
<hi>French</hi> Mini≈øters would vnite their Offices with the
<hi>Spaniards;</hi> which was diuer≈øly interpreted. Some ≈øaid it was out of his de≈øire that the Accord might be effected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he feared left, if they proceeded ≈øeuerally, they might hinder one the other through rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon ≈øie, or other re≈øpects, which ordinarily doe
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:17285:160"/> not permit that any Affaire come to good end, which is handled by two Mediators, who doe not communicate together. Others ≈øaid on the contrary, that to hinder all good ≈øucce≈ø≈øe in the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, he de≈øired that it might be managed by the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> to the end that one ≈øhould vndoe what the other had done, which v≈øually comes to pa≈ø≈øe, when an Affaire is vndertaken ioyntly by tho≈øe who haue diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ends and intere≈øts, and when there is no likelyhood that the one will yeeld to the other. At <hi>Rome, Alincourt</hi> an≈øwered, that it was nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øarie to haue fir≈øt ≈øome order and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the <hi>King.</hi> And at <hi>Venice, Fre≈øne</hi> was di≈øplea≈øed, that ≈øuch a thought ≈øhould come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the

               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:17285:160"/> when they had a purpo≈øe to grant more then they had done at the in≈øtance of the <hi>King</hi> his Ma≈øter, that it would plea≈øe them to let him know it, to the end that he might accordingly gouerne him≈øelfe. Al≈øo when the re≈øolution gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to <hi>Don Francis de Ca≈øtro,</hi> that they would not in any ≈øort conde≈øcend to the Su≈øpen≈øion, was communicated to him, he a≈ø≈øured them his <hi>King</hi> in that Matter would ≈øollicite them to farther.</p>
            <p>Whil≈øt the≈øe things were treated at <hi>Rome</hi> and a

And when they could not be heard neither of the

He made al≈øo a view of Armes which were within the Magazins, where he found 1500. Harne≈ø≈øe for the body, 2000. Harquebuzes, and 500. Muskets. He prohibited the <hi>Mini≈øters</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> to carry any Armes out of the
<hi>State,</hi> and cancelled a contract made with <hi>Tauerna,</hi> Brother of the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> for 4000. Harquebuzes and 1000. Muskets, the money to be payed, within three yeares, though they were ≈øold at ≈øo high a rate, that it was rather a ran≈øome, than a bargaine. Notwith≈øtanding, the
<hi>Count</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued that <hi>Milan</hi> was not ≈øufficient to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh him with Armes, whereof he might haue

Muskets, which were ≈øpeedily granted He di≈øpatched al≈øo
<hi>Nicholas Doria</hi> Ma≈øter of the Campe, with 20000. Crownes, to a≈ø≈øure him 3000. <hi>Wallons,</hi> who quickly returned without doing any thing; becau≈øe the <hi>Archduke</hi> hauing v≈øe of men for his owne occa≈øions would not permit the Leuie. He treated likewi≈øe with the
<hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Emps</hi> to leuie 4000. Lance-knights, to put them in Armes beyond the Mountaines, and to oppo≈øe the <hi>Lorraines,</hi> but nothing was executed. He cau≈øed a mu≈øter of <hi>Hor≈øemen</hi> to be made at <hi>Lodi</hi> and at <hi>Pauia,</hi> but they appeared all on borrowed hor≈øes; and to prouide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe of ≈øome good hor≈øe, be≈øides the 250. light hor≈øe of the Guard, and the ordinarie Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of ≈øouldiers (the number whereof excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not 200.) he adioyned 600. Cuira≈øles well arm'd and mounted, although the bruit ran that they were 800. Whereupon he had in foot
14000. men, and 650. hor≈øe. He made account to lodge the <hi>Albanes,</hi> gathered out of the Realme of <hi>Naples,</hi> within the <hi>State</hi> of

            </p>
            <p>All the≈øe Proui≈øions could not be pre≈øently in readine≈ø≈øe, but onely in the end of <hi>March</hi> arriued at <hi>Vare≈øe</hi> almo≈øt all the <hi>Germans,</hi> ≈øtout men and old Souldiers, who had beene in the Warres of <hi>Hungary,</hi> but were without Armes, bare foot and naked, many being ≈øicke for want of nece≈ø≈øaries, and it was thought they had the Plague among≈øt them. After the Moneth of <hi>Aprill,</hi> the
<hi>Sui≈ø≈øes</hi> began to arriue at <hi>Lomellina,</hi> and being about the number of 3000. were ≈øent to lodge in the Territory of <hi>Lodi:</hi> and hauing no other meanes to lodge the 3000 <hi>Neapolitans,</hi> he thought to giue them lodging in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs of <hi>Milan,</hi> which highly offended the
<hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> complaining that their Priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges were violated, and the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of the Proui≈øions gaue him to vnder≈øtand that hee would not con≈øent to this, making thereupon many Prote≈øtations. And certes in all that ≈øpace of time the <hi>Count</hi> found many ob≈øtacles. The other Mini≈øters of the <hi>Catholique King</hi> had little corre≈øpondence with him, ≈øo as <hi>Don Francis de Ca≈øtro</hi> did not communicate vnto him any thing of that which hee treated at
<hi>Venice.</hi> He
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:17285:166"/> had need of money, and the Commons of the State of <hi>Milan</hi> not onely did not obey him cheerefully, but euen made re≈øi≈øtance; ≈øo that the plea≈øure which he tooke in Arming, was very much counterpoy≈øed with many vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing Accidents which fell out.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> ≈øeeing the

500000. Crownes, 100000. for each Citie to prepare them≈øelues for all Exigents. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the 9600. footmen, and 600. hor≈øe, and 150. hor≈øe of

So that the <hi>Republique</hi> brought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in all 75. light Gallies, and 4. great ones: and in this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe they did not finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues in like ca≈øe with the
<hi>Pope,</hi> who was faine to v≈øe praiers to many <hi>Princes</hi> for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his reputation; becau≈øe be≈øides the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary offers made to the <hi>Republique</hi> by a great number of the <hi>French</hi> Nobilitie, the <hi>Turkes</hi> them≈øelues did all they could that their ≈øuccours might be accepted. For be≈øides that which hath beene ≈øaid by occa≈øion of the ≈øacking of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razzo</hi> in the beginning of the yeere, the ≈øecond
<hi>Vi≈øier</hi> (the fir≈øt being then at the Warre of <hi>Soria,)</hi> ≈øent for the <hi>Baylife,</hi> and gaue him notice that the <hi>Grand Seignor</hi> would ≈øend an Armie to Sea in fauour of the Affaires of the

<hi>Sangiacs</hi> of the Confines to giue them leaue to draw out men of War and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition: but that this was nothing, that it was
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:17285:167"/> meet to come to effects &amp; not only to ≈øtay vpon words. That to free them≈øelues at once from all ≈øtratagems and dangers, the <hi>Repub.</hi> ought to vnite with them, to admit their powerfull ≈øuccour, and come to a ≈øpeedy execution. The <hi>Baylife</hi> thanked him and ≈øaid, that as yet the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> had no purpo≈øe but to defend them≈øelues, which they hoped to doe by their owne Forces, and the aid of other <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> their Friends yet that he receiued willingly their offer to ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a leuie of <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> their Subiects, with vicutals.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the <hi>Popes</hi> when they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite all the world vnto their ≈øuccour, were wont to take the pretext of <hi>Religion:</hi> but this Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence hath now ≈øhewed, that if euer the <hi>Pope</hi> ≈øhould be willing to moue Warre vnder this colour, he would prouoke more men again≈øt him then on his ≈øide. The <hi>Turkes</hi> built great De≈øignes vpon the≈øe Controuer≈øies, in ≈øo much that they ordained publique fa≈øts and praiers for the continuance of Di≈øcord among <hi>Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and to thanke
<hi>God</hi> for that he had giuen a <hi>Pope</hi> more fauourable to them then any <hi>Mufti</hi> which they could de≈øire. The <hi>Republique</hi> well vnder≈øtood that it is not profitable to any

<hi>Spaniards</hi> touching the Fort of <hi>Fuentes,</hi> it was not expedient to exhau≈øt the Countrey of men or good ≈øouldiers; and further they frighted the more feeble, telling them, that this was to

<hi>Captaines</hi> were all of the <hi>Priuy Councell,</hi> and well affected to <hi>France;</hi> and that when they were departed, it was to be feared that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might creepe into their places, not well di≈øpo≈øed either to the mo≈øt <hi>Chri≈øtian King</hi> or to the <hi>Republique.</hi> But when at la≈øt the≈øe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were ≈øurmounted, and there was ≈øome hope to effect this Leuie, there hapned in the Month of <hi>September</hi> another hindrance, which was a controuer≈øie betweene the <hi>Canton</hi> of

<hi>Sui≈ø≈øes,</hi> in ca≈øe that any thing ≈øhould be attempted again≈øt their Liberty. They purpo≈øed to ≈øend to <hi>Venice, Hercules de Salis,</hi> with charge to a≈ø≈øure the <hi>Republique</hi> of the Leuie, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ≈øuccours. They determined likewi≈øe to require of the <hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> the re≈øtitution of the Pri≈øoners, which yet they had no hope to
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:17285:169"/> obtaine; as al≈øo they made a di≈øpatch vnto the <hi>Sui≈ø≈øes</hi> Prote≈øtants to demand their a≈ø≈øi≈øtance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salis</hi> then being arriued at <hi>Venice,</hi> pre≈øented him≈øelfe vnto the <hi>Duke,</hi> and fir≈øt complained, in the behalfe of his Ma≈øters, of the enterpri≈øes which the <hi>Pope</hi> made vpon them: then promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed the entertainment of the Capitulation; and finally recounted the particular grieuances w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they receiued from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou≈øies which they gaue them, affirming that they further menaced them to take the <hi>Valto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line.</hi> He adioyned that they were re≈øolued not to ≈øuffer any longer the≈øe Iniuries, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary that they would enterpri≈øe to recouer the Fort. That they praied his <hi>Serenitie</hi> to declare what aid they would afford them in this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pri≈øe, which how≈øoeuer it ≈øeemed particularly to touch his Ma≈øters, yet it imported haply more the liberty of all <hi>Italy.</hi> He ≈øaid moreouer, that the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> had declared him≈øelfe, and that ≈øome of the <hi>Prote≈øtant Sui≈ø≈øes</hi> had imitated the <hi>King,</hi> and others expected what the <hi>Repub.</hi> would do: that the <hi>Catholique Sui≈ø≈øes</hi> held them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues neutrall. He touched al≈øo particularly the great preiudice which the <hi>Republique</hi> ≈øhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, in ca≈øe that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ≈øhould make
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:17285:170"/> them≈øelues <hi>Ma≈øters</hi> of the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> or ≈øhould ≈øhut vp that pa≈ø≈øage, or finally reduce the there Leagues to the ancient Capitulation. In the end he repeated the re≈øolution of tho≈øe Peoples to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer them≈øelues from all the≈øe enterpri≈øes, and per≈øwaded the <hi>Republique</hi> to re≈øolue to giue them powerfull A≈ø≈øi≈øtance, alledging the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of many things done by Them to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Liberty of <hi>Italy.</hi>

            <p>The an≈øwer to this <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> was a thanking of his

            <p>But be≈øides the proui≈øions made by the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi> for an Armie by <hi>Sea,</hi> and then Leuy of <hi>Italians,</hi> as we haue ≈øaid, the <hi>Senate</hi> hauing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the De≈øignes of <hi>Count Fuentes,</hi> gaue commandement to their <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> in

Wherefore that he ≈øhould intreat the <hi>King</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him≈øelfe, and what the <hi>Republique</hi> might promi≈øe them≈øelues from him, in ca≈øe the <hi>Pope</hi> ≈øhould not deale vprightly, which it was nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary they ≈øhould know ≈øpeedily, and that his <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> might tell the <hi>Pope</hi> thereof re≈øolutely. This was communicated to <hi>Fre≈øne,</hi> who an≈øwered, that the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Ma≈øter</hi> knew, that the

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:17285:171"/> ≈øince the <hi>Nuntio</hi> hath complained in
<hi>Spain,</hi> that the <hi>King</hi> hath not fauoured the <hi>Pope,</hi> but only with vaine words; whereupon that <hi>King</hi> ≈øeeing his Reputation impaired, hath writ to the <hi>Count de Fuentes,</hi> and to his other

And this was; that the <hi>K.</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtood by good intelligence, that the <hi>Count Fuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> hauing a De≈øigne to goe armed into <hi>Paradi≈øe,</hi>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:17285:171"/> was purpo≈øed to come into the

But if by their refu≈øall they did occa≈øion <hi>Don Francis de Ca≈øtro</hi> to retire, the <hi>King</hi> might then after continue the Treatie, wherein he would imploy him≈øelfe with affection. And if they imagined the <hi>Pope</hi> might be wonne by faire meanes, hee iudged fit that they ≈øhould ≈øignifie all vnto the

            <p>For, the Holidaies were no ≈øooner pa≈øt, but hee appeared in the

<hi>French Amba≈ø≈øador,</hi> for as much as his <hi>King</hi> refu≈øed not Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>panions in this good work, but he de≈øired to know what kinde of Vnion he might haue with the <hi>French:</hi> that he expected an≈øwers more cleare and ample than had beene giuen him. That de≈øiring a good ≈øucce≈ø≈øe in this Affaire, he had waited, &amp; would yet wait with patience, but he looked for ≈øome Declaration of what might be done by vniting him≈øelfe with the

            <p>In <hi>Spaine</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lerma</hi> complained to the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> of <hi>England</hi> of the Demon≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

            <p>
               <hi>Padauin</hi> had Audience of the <hi>Count de Vaude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> and declared his Commi≈ø≈øion, reporting vnto him what he had Treated with them of <hi>Zurich</hi> and the other <hi>Sui≈ø≈øes,</hi> and gaue him to vnder≈øtand that the money was ready for the Leuies, and that now nothing wanted but to come to execution. The <hi>Count</hi> an≈øwerd coldly that he would doe his duty, and take care to Treat the other particulars, but he praied him to con≈øider that he was onely a Sonne in the Family, and that he depended vpon his Father, with whom it was nece≈ø≈øarie fir≈øt to ≈øpeake. The

The

            <p>The great <hi>Duche≈ø≈øe</hi> his Si≈øter writ vnto him, that he ≈øhould not, by ≈øeruing in fauour of the <hi>Republique,</hi> cau≈øe in the end a Warre damage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Friends and preiudiciall to all

            <p>But the <hi>Cardinall de Ioyeu≈øe</hi> hauing at length receiued very ample in≈øtructions from his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe,</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Cardinall</hi> immediately gaue beginning vnto the Treaty; ≈øaying, that he had Commi≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the <hi>King</hi> to procure the weale and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of the <hi>Republique,</hi> and becau≈øe he knew how profitable Peace was, both to them and to all <hi>Chri≈øtendome,</hi> he had interpo≈øed him≈øelfe in this Agreement. Therefore hee de≈øired there might be found ≈øome temperament to ≈øatisfie the <hi>Pope,</hi> and to maintaine the Reputation of the <hi>Republique.</hi> That the <hi>Pope</hi> expected and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed (be≈øides that which had beene treated,)
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:17285:192"/> that the <hi>Republique</hi> ≈øhould ≈øend an <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> to require his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> to take away and reuoke his <hi>Cen≈øures;</hi> that all the <hi>Religious,</hi> e≈øpecially the <hi>Ie≈øuites,</hi> ≈øhould be re≈øtored; and that the
<hi>King</hi> might giue his word to the <hi>Pope,</hi> that the Lawes ≈øhould not be executed during the Treaty. Vpon which point, the <hi>Cardinall</hi> in≈øi≈øting more than vpon any other, prayed them to yeeld that the

            <p>If ≈øeemed very ≈øtrange to the <hi>Senate</hi> that the

<hi>Republique,</hi> and to their Ance≈øtors: That this ought ≈øufficiently to ≈øatisfie the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>King.</hi> Hereupon the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> te≈øtified, that the <hi>King</hi> his <hi>Ma≈øter</hi> was greatly ≈øatisfied
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:17285:193"/> with all that which the <hi>Republique</hi> had yeelded to the <hi>Pope</hi> in Fauour of Him: But his

<hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> for the Seruice of the <hi>Republique,</hi> for the quiet of <hi>Chri≈øtendome,</hi> and for the de≈øire of Peace, prayed them to finde ≈øome temper, by meanes whereof, without hurting the Liberty and Dignity of the <hi>Republique,</hi> the Bu≈øine≈ø≈øe might be fini≈øhed.

            <p>Another day the <hi>Cardinall</hi> returned with an in≈øtance more vehement and more particular, demanding that the <hi>King</hi> might giue his word vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> that the Lawes ≈øhould not be Practi≈øed during the Treaty; which he endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to per≈øwade, ≈øaying, That the

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:17285:193"/> the≈øe Differences with Reputation, pre≈øeruing entire the Libertie of the <hi>Republique,</hi> con≈øidering it was no ≈øea≈øon to take Armes. And to this end hee had charge to ≈øpeake to them, as men ought to Friends, clearely and freely, but with this Caution, not to doe preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice vnto their Friend. Wherefore he ≈øaid free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his
<hi>Serenity,</hi> that as the <hi>King</hi> approued that no Decree might be made whereby might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare the Su≈øpen≈øion of the Lawes, or that they had not bin executed, or any other which might bring damage to the publique Dignity or Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not any act which might remaine in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or by memory pa≈ø≈øe to Po≈øterity: So againe he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øidered that the <hi>Pope</hi> hauing publi≈øhed the <hi>Cen≈øures</hi> in the ≈øight of the World, it was nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary that he ≈øhould haue ≈øome apparent rea≈øon to reuoke them.

<hi>Republique,</hi> and to their contentment.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cardinall</hi> adioyned a long con≈øideration, how in the beginning, in the progre≈ø≈øe, and at the end of the≈øe Differences, all things had pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed with ≈øo much Reputation on the ≈øide of the
<hi>Republique,</hi> as they could not expect more. But the Time now coun≈øelled them to con≈øider the dangers &amp; damages which might en≈øue for the time to come, ≈øuch as all the World abhorred, as contrarily the Agreement was vniuer≈øally de≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Wherefore it was not fit to reiect a motion
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:17285:194"/> by meanes whereof all que≈øtions might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided with credit. When the <hi>Cardinall</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
<hi>Moun≈øieur de Fre≈øne</hi> Propo≈øed, that the <hi>King</hi> ≈øeeing it was nece≈ø≈øary to giue the <hi>Pope</hi> this word, who by all meanes de≈øired this ≈øatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ≈øince it was meet to giue it Him, who had (at the in≈øtance of the <hi>King)</hi> conde≈øcended to this Treaty, this point ought not to be put in difficulty, but to be holden as re≈øolued: That it was not to the purpo≈øe to examine whether it were rea≈øonable, in as much as it was not propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed out of rea≈øon, but only to giue ≈øome pretext vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> that he might be able to retire him≈øelfe with ≈øome Reputation. Wherefore the <hi>Pope</hi> being con≈øtant to haue this word, and the <hi>Senate</hi> (rightly) iudging it vniu≈øt to make any Decree, it was needfull to finde ≈øome meanes to giue it. For (to ≈øpeake freely) who≈øoeuer ≈øhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øider the Decree of the <hi>Senate</hi> literally, which had bin read vnto them, where it was ≈øaid, <hi>That in the v≈øe of the Lawes they would not depart from their accu≈øtomed piety,</hi> &amp;c. They ≈øhould ≈øee plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the <hi>Republique</hi> re≈øerued ≈øtill to them≈øelues Power to v≈øe them: and the <hi>Pope</hi> did not intend that they ≈øhould be v≈øed, but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ≈øhould be, as it were, bound by the word
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:17285:195"/> which the <hi>King</hi> ≈øhould giue him touching them: therefore that it was nece≈ø≈øary to declare them≈øelues. If the <hi>Senate</hi> did meane that the≈øe words ≈øhould ≈øuffice to giue a≈ø≈øurance that the Lawes ≈øhould not be executed, and if they did not v≈øe the≈øe words <hi>[in the u≈øe]</hi> to any other end but that it might not appeare in writing that they began againe to execute them, then it was fit at lea≈øt to make this appeare by ≈øome ≈øigne, ≈øo as the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> might ≈øerue him≈øelfe of this Expo≈øition: That it would ≈øuffice him if either by ≈øpeech or action they gaue him a ≈øigne here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ≈øuch as he might comprehend. Becau≈øe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>King</hi> would giue his word in writing, it behoued that he ≈øhould be a≈ø≈øured that the
<hi>Republique</hi> would not di≈øauow it, and that he might not haue occa≈øion to repent him≈øelfe to haue giuen it, and ≈øo to remaine di≈øgu≈øted; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very much that the <hi>King</hi> ≈øhould make the
<hi>Pope</hi> contented with this fal≈øe money, this word being to ≈øerue only as a pure ceremony. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the <hi>King</hi> ≈øaid, that the Lawes being prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiue, and con≈øi≈øting in <hi>nonfaciendo,</hi> they had their Execution whil≈øt things re≈øted in ≈øu≈øpence; hauing taken vpon him to worke in ≈øuch ≈øort, that on the part of the <hi>Pope</hi> and the
<hi>Eccle≈øia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtiques,</hi>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:17285:195"/> nothing ≈øhould be done to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And the <hi>King</hi> might be well able to giue this word without ≈øaying any more; as being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that if the <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øtiques</hi> on their part ≈øhould not make any enterpri≈øe in this regard, the <hi>Mini≈øters</hi> of the <hi>Republique</hi> ≈øhould not be occa≈øioned to come to the execution of their Lawes; ≈øo that as on the one ≈øide they ≈øhould not be executed, ≈øo on the other they ≈øhould not be violated. And here the
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> repeated, that although the <hi>King</hi> might giue this word without the con≈øent of the <hi>Republique,</hi> in as much as it ≈øufficed him to be a≈ø≈øured by the <hi>Pope,</hi> that no
<hi>Eccle≈øia≈øtique</hi> ≈øhould giue occa≈øion to the execution of the≈øe Lawes again≈øt his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe,</hi> nor to the violation again≈øt the <hi>Republique,</hi> notwith≈øtanding it was nece≈ø≈øary that the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> ≈øhould giue him ≈øome an≈øwer. <hi>Fre≈øne</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned moreouer, that vnder≈øtanding how the <hi>Spaniards</hi> pre≈ø≈øed to haue the ≈øame word, but in a more open and explicite fa≈øhion, the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> had purpo≈øely thus tempered his Propo≈øition; beleeuing it not to be conuenient for the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> that they ≈øhould re≈øt obliged by the word of two <hi>Kings,</hi> ≈øpecially ≈øince the

<pb n="364" facs="tcp:17285:196"/> ≈øweetne≈ø≈øe with which his <hi>King</hi> would be ≈øatisfied.

For tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ree≈øtabli≈øhment of the <hi>Ie≈øuites,</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued there would be no difficulty, ≈øince the <hi>K.</hi> did not doubt of it; being an ordinary thing in Agreements, that they who haue fomented the one and the other party returne again into their places: ≈øeeing e≈øpecially that the <hi>Pope</hi> could not con≈øent without wronging his Reputation, that they who went out only to obey him, ≈øhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine excluded. And he did not thinke that this difficulty could be ≈øurmounted, con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that they had to doe with a <hi>Pope</hi> ≈øtiffe and heady, and there being no particular cau≈øe why they ≈øhould deny him this ≈øatisfaction. That he was willing to ≈øpeake of this point which had beene pa≈ø≈øed in ≈øilence by the <hi>Card</hi> through mode≈øty, to the end that herein might be no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment when they came to the Conclu≈øion of the Affaire.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Senate</hi> an≈øwered the <hi>Cardinall</hi> that the bani≈øhment of the <hi>Ie≈øuites</hi> had beene decreed for cau≈øes ≈øo important, and with ≈øuch formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that by the Lawes of the

For the re≈øt, the <hi>Senate</hi> ≈øaid, that they could not but commend the good will of the <hi>King,</hi> and of the
<hi>Cardinall,</hi> and thanke them both for their good aduice: But for the matter of giuing any word touching the execution of the Lawes, the
<hi>Senate</hi> could ≈øay nothing el≈øe, than that which they had ≈øo often repeated, that in the v≈øe of them they would neuer depart from their ancient Piety and Religion, which might ≈øuffice the <hi>King</hi> and the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> in that point, adding that they would communicate the ≈øame to <hi>Don Francis de Ca≈øtro.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Cardinall</hi> had a de≈øire to haue obtained more, and to haue receiued an an≈øwer more conformable to his propo≈øition: neuerthele≈ø≈øe
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:17285:197"/> being come with re≈øolution from the
<hi>Pope</hi> to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>modate vpon any termes the Contention, yet with the mo≈øt aduantage that he might, he ≈øaid, That although he wi≈øhed to haue had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer more conformable to his demand, and though he had no great rea≈øon to thanke them for that hee had receiued; notwith≈øtanding ≈øince that the <hi>King</hi> was willing to haue all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the contentment of the
<hi>Republique,</hi> hee would content him≈øelfe, reque≈øting them not to publi≈øh to any whom≈øoeuer this their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer, but to conceale it ≈øecret, fora≈ømuch as the Affaire might be di≈øturbed by ≈øome Spirit enuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the common good, and ≈øecrecy alone might much conduce to a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>clu≈øion. The <hi>Duke</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ≈øaid, that of nece≈ø≈øitie they mu≈øt needs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer the pur≈øuits of <hi>Don Francis,</hi> who hauing made the like and equiualent propo≈øitions, mu≈øt al≈øo receiue the like an≈øwer, e≈øpecially ≈øeeing he te≈øtified a good intention. That neuerthele≈ø≈øe they would doe it with ≈øuch re≈øeruedne≈ø≈øe and caution that the ≈øecret ≈øhould not be too much publi≈øhed: That this ought not to moue the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> becau≈øe it was a thing well knowne to all, that all had beene to gratifie him, and all that followed vpon this
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:17285:197"/> Treaty mu≈øt be a≈øcribed to him. The
<hi>Cardinall</hi> confe≈ø≈øed that <hi>Don Francis de Ca≈øtro</hi> had a good intention, affirming that he would euery where giue him this te≈øtimonie: but he beleeued not, that he had in this Affaire the like power from the
<hi>Catholique King,</hi> as had the Mini≈øters of <hi>France</hi> from their
<hi>King:</hi> becau≈øe the termes which they de≈øigned to v≈øe with the
<hi>Pope,</hi> came from the ≈øole inuention of his Maty, wherwith if others were acquainted he would willingly vnite with them: But knowing not whether others had the ≈øame in≈øtructions, he iudged ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy nece≈ø≈øary, reque≈øting them to proceed with dexteritie, and not to vtter all at once, but ≈øo to carry the matter as might be≈øt ≈øerue to make a conclu≈øion of this Bu≈øine≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>Notwith≈øtanding the≈øe rea≈øons the <hi>Senate</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained firme in their purpo≈øe to communicate all to <hi>Don Francis de Ca≈øtro,</hi> as well becau≈øe he had made the ≈øame propo≈øition, as becau≈øe at the arriuall of the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> he went to vi≈øit him, and offered to vnite him≈øelfe with him, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the intentions of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> and of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique King,</hi> and of the
<hi>Republique,</hi> ≈øo far that he ≈øaid vnto the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> that he would fight vnder his Colours. To which the <hi>Cardinall</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:17285:198"/> an≈øwered, that he could ≈øay nothing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, becau≈øe he expected a certaine an≈øwer from the <hi>Republique; Don Francis</hi> much maruelled that the <hi>Cardinall</hi> made difficulty of this Vnion, and was many times in≈øtant with the <hi>Senate</hi> to declare vnto him what an≈øwer that was which the <hi>Card.</hi> expected. And although the
<hi>Senate</hi> had imparted all vnto him (whereof he was well a≈ø≈øured,) yet he iu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>dged aright, that the Vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> was neuer the neerer: And therfore he made in≈øtance ≈øeparately, that for the honour of his <hi>King</hi> and of Him≈øelfe, they would accord him ≈øomething further, not preiudiciall. For although they had formerly done much, yet that ≈øufficed not: but when they ≈øhould accord a Su≈øpen≈øion of the Lawes for ≈øome Moneths, ≈øo as he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed, all would bee accommodated, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided that they did it ≈øpeedily, to the end that the Armes now in readine≈ø≈øe might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no ≈øcandall. But when this la≈øt an≈øwer giuen vnto the <hi>Cardinall</hi> was communicated to him, hee ≈øaid, it was not ≈øo cleare as hee de≈øired: But although the words were not ≈øo intelligible as he could wi≈øh, yet it ≈øeemed to him that he might thence inferre, that the <hi>King</hi> might giue his word for not executing the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:17285:198"/> Lawes during the Treaty, and that ≈øo the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtood them. But becau≈øe he would walke ≈øafely and with ≈øincerity, he remembred them, that when he ≈øiguified vnto them how that the
<hi>Pope</hi> would take away the <hi>Cen≈øures</hi> and conclude the Affaire, ≈øo that he had the word of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique King,</hi> that during the Treaty the Lawes ≈øhould not be ob≈øerued; this he ≈øaid pre≈øuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing the word to be cleare and without any vaile. And though he beleeued that they would haue it ≈øo taken, yet neuerthele≈ø≈øe he wi≈øhed it had beene clearer. And how≈øoeuer he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with it, becau≈øe he pre≈øuppo≈øed the <hi>Cardinal</hi> in like manner to be contented, yet he could not ingage his word in a thing vncertaine, wherewith he knew the <hi>Pope</hi> would not be ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied: but onely he would repre≈øent the e≈øtate of Affaires, and ≈øee what the <hi>Pope</hi> would ≈øay. That he imagined the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> to be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it, becau≈øe he had told him, he had brought an aduice from his <hi>King,</hi> vpon which he expected the an≈øwer of the <hi>Republique,</hi> and that he would not be di≈øta≈øted if the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> could vpon good conditions fini≈øh the bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe. He added, that although this delay di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øed him, which was cau≈øed by their ob≈øcure
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:17285:199"/> an≈øwer, whereby the Affaire might be prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, repeating many times, although he de≈øired more clearene≈ø≈øe in their an≈øwer, neuerthele≈ø≈øe he would ≈øo vnder≈øtand it, that in vertue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he might pa≈ø≈øe his word; in the end conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that he would expound their ≈øilence to be a confe≈ø≈øion.</p>
            <p>To this la≈øt point the <hi>Duke</hi> an≈øwered, that the
<hi>Senate</hi> ≈øpake very clearely, and in ≈øuch ≈øort that any one might vnder≈øtand them without any need of expo≈øitions or coniectures; that they intended not in any fa≈øhion to de≈øi≈øt from the v≈øe of their Lawes e≈øtabli≈øhed with iu≈øtice and lawfull authority; how≈øoeuer they promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed to practi≈øe them with their accu≈øtomed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and moderation, and ≈øo as behoued the ancient piety and deuotion of the
<hi>Republique.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Treaties were thus in ≈øuch forwardnes, that there was, as it were, a firme hope of an Accord, if on the contrary the precipitation of
<hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> to take Armes, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of the
<hi>Gri≈øons</hi> (which not onely conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued but increa≈øed,) had not forced men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> wi≈øhed Warre, and that they entertained the world with propo≈øitions of Peace, when in the meane while their facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:17285:199"/> Parti≈øans continued to moue euill humors, and procure ≈øeditions, not onely by fal≈øe reports (which preuaile much among ba≈øe people,) but further by gifts and pre≈øents, which corrupt tho≈øe who cannot be deceiued. In <hi>Spaine</hi> they ob≈øerued the danger of the≈øe running rumors; therefore at that ≈øame time when the <hi>King</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the <hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> to draw out 10000. Musketiers, he writ vnto him withall, that ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the danger of Warre by the di≈ø≈øentions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Republique,</hi> to diuert it he had declared him≈øelfe for the <hi>Pope,</hi> that he might merit well of the
<hi>Holy See,</hi> and cau≈øe him to conde≈øcend and accept the conditions which he refu≈øed: That to this purpo≈øe he had ≈øent <hi>Don Francis de Ca≈øtro</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> where fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding greater re≈øi≈øtance then he had thought, he had giuen him charge to vnite his offices with tho≈øe of other
<hi>Princes.</hi> But the difficulties ≈øtill growing, he had beene willing to try the la≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, which was to ≈øhew him≈øelfe intere≈ø≈øed for the
<hi>Church,</hi> and by this meanes to take from the <hi>Republique</hi> their hopes grounded vpon the <hi>Popes</hi> feeblene≈ø≈øe. But fora≈ømuch as this was ≈øini≈øterly interpreted by ≈øome ill affeoted, he was re≈øolued to publi≈øh this his Deliberation (giuing
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:17285:200"/> notice thereof to his Mini≈øters,) to wit, that they ≈øhould not take deca≈øious, how fit ≈øoeuer, to ≈øo ment the Warre.</p>
            <p>Among the <hi>Gri≈øons,</hi> the Mutiners were now to the number of
2000 among≈øt whom a bruit was cunningly ≈øeattered, that the <hi>Repub.</hi> of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> had bought the pa≈ø≈øage for 80000 crowns, and therefore they would know by who≈øe hands this money had pa≈ø≈øed. Vpon which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion the <hi>Re≈øident</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> finding him≈øelfe not ≈øafe at <hi>Coira,</hi> purpo≈øed to retire him≈øelfe to <hi>To≈øana.</hi> But the Muriners, without any re≈øpect, came 200. of them into his Hou≈øe and ≈øtaied him, ≈øaying, That it was no time to be going, but to giue them account who they were that had receiued the money from the <hi>Signiory</hi> of
<hi>Venice,</hi> and pa≈ø≈øed to very in≈øolent ≈øpeeches; whereupon the
<hi>Re≈øident</hi> was forced to retire him≈øelfe. He made complaint of this affront to the <hi>Councell,</hi> requiring that they might be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øti≈øed; but in the <hi>Councell</hi> there was neither power nor vertue, the principall of them and mo≈øt couragious being ab≈øent, ≈øome hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired them≈øelues becau≈øe of the≈øe ≈øtirres, and others being in the
<hi>Valtoline</hi> or in <hi>Amba≈ø≈øage</hi> Notwith≈øtanding tho≈øe of the <hi>Councell</hi> offered
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:17285:200"/> him a conuoy to conduct him to
<hi>To≈øana,</hi> with which being on the way, he was encountred by a multitude of people, who con≈øtrained him to returne into his Hou≈øe, where he was guarded as a pri≈øoner, not ≈øuffered to write or receiue a Letter: Onely to ≈øweeten a little this barbarous v≈øage, they gaue him foure Gentlemen to beare him company. Afterward a rumor was rai≈øed that the
<hi>Lorraines</hi> were in the field, and ≈øaid that they would open the pa≈ø≈øage by force if it were not yeelded in amity; which renewed againe the mutiny, ≈øo as the multitude came with ≈øuch fury to the <hi>Re≈øidents</hi> hou≈øe, that he could hardly be defended by his guard. The Parti≈øans of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> although they were bankrupt, yet cea≈øed not to ≈øcatter money and put in Armes their Adherents; but with all this they could not hinder, but that the multitude at length gaue care to better coun≈øell, and was per≈øwaded to expect the a≈ø≈øembly of all the Companies, and in the meane while to free the <hi>Re≈øident,</hi> vpon promi≈øe that he ≈øhould arrend the A≈ø≈øembly. It was the ≈øeuenth day after he had beene forced that he was ≈øet at liberty; but by and by after followed a new encounter. For the ≈øouldiers that had beene leuied for the ≈øeruice of the
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi>
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:17285:201"/> cited their Captaines, and commanded them to giue their pay; which forced the <hi>Re≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> to giue the Captaines
2000. Crownes for this effect, and by that meanes the Sedition was pacified, and in the <hi>interim</hi> the Troupes or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies were a≈ø≈øembled.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Spaine,</hi> becau≈øe the Negotiation of <hi>Don Francis de Ca≈øtro</hi> did not ≈øucceed as they de≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ≈øince the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Sauoy</hi> made conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall in≈øtances to the
<hi>King,</hi> that he would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue his iourney to <hi>Venice,</hi> they re≈øolued at length to giue way vnto him, although they held him rather a Souldier then a fit in≈øtrument of Peace, thinking it al≈øo dangerous to deny him ≈øuch a demand. Notwith≈øtanding they gaue him an ambiguous an≈øwer, as beleeuing not that he would Treat conformably to the intention of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> but that as a ≈øouldier hee thought to be employed in the Warre by one of the Parties, rather then to agree them. And becau≈øe they began to ≈øu≈øpect that the <hi>Pope</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying vpon the ≈øuccours of
<hi>Spaine</hi> would refu≈øe too ≈øtifly to admit a Concord, the
<hi>Catholique King</hi> aduerti≈øed the <hi>Nuntio</hi> by his Mini≈øters, that, to the end they might be more ready in <hi>Italy,</hi> he had giuen order vnto all the Captaines
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:17285:201"/> (who were retired to repo≈øe them≈øelues in their hou≈øes,) that they ≈øhould pre≈øent them≈øelues with all the power they could vpon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>France,</hi> and had al≈øo written vnto the <hi>Viceroys</hi> of <hi>Bar√ßelona</hi> and of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> that they ≈øhould put all the Forces they could po≈ø≈øibly in the Forts vpon the Frontiers. Neuerthele≈ø≈øe they adioyned, that it would well become the
<hi>Pope,</hi> for diuer≈øion of the≈øe broyles and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, to ≈øupport ≈øome ≈ømall faults in his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, though to him they ≈øeemed great. And a few daies after on another occa≈øion they told the <hi>Nuntio,</hi> that the
<hi>King</hi> ≈øhould doe more ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice vnto the <hi>Apo≈øtolique See</hi> by repre≈ø≈øing the Heretiques in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> then by fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the troubles of <hi>Italy,</hi> and that ≈øo much the more as the
<hi>Pope</hi> ≈øhould bee a≈ø≈øi≈øted by <hi>Spaine,</hi> ≈øo much the more ≈øtraitly would the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> league them≈øelues with the enemies of the <hi>Catholique</hi> faith: wherefore it was good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, that the <hi>Pope</hi> ≈øhould neglect his owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate intere≈øts for the vniuer≈øall good of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtendome.</hi> In conclu≈øion, to ≈øpeake more cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they ≈øaid, that it did not be≈øeeme the Father of all
<hi>Chri≈øtendome</hi> to ground a Warre ≈øo cruell and pernicious to
<hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> people, vpon a <hi>King</hi>
               <pb n="376" facs="tcp:17285:202"/> ≈øo pious, and that his
<hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> would aba≈øe the <hi>Apo≈øtolique</hi> Dignitie, if he ≈øu≈øtained by humane meanes the Authority which <hi>God</hi> had giuen him. They ≈øaid further, that it was meet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the <hi>King</hi> with ≈øome thing for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration which he had made, ≈øince thereby he had drawne vpon him≈øelfe ≈øo many enemies: aiming herein either at the
<hi>Tenths</hi> of the <hi>Realme</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> or at the remitting of the <hi>Fief.</hi> It is certaine that this newes extremely troubled the
<hi>Pope,</hi> ≈øeeing them when there was no need to make ≈øo liberall offers, and in time of nece≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thus to retire.</p>
            <p>But in <hi>Lorraine,</hi> the <hi>Count de Vaudemont</hi> fell ≈øicke. Some attributed the cau≈øe thereof to a wound which he had receiued in his head, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing a <hi>Hart</hi> a yeare before, whereby he lo≈øt a good quantity of bloud; and others to the vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which he receiued by the importunities of ≈øo many in different places. In the meane while, Aduices came from <hi>Italy,</hi> that the Di≈ø≈øentions were likely to be accommodated. <hi>Montagu</hi> the <hi>Re≈øident</hi> at <hi>Venice</hi> for the great <hi>Duke,</hi> writ vnto the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> that the <hi>Cardinal de Ioyeu≈øe</hi> and <hi>Fre≈øne</hi> had a≈ø≈øured him that the Accord would certainly follow their Negotiation; but
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:17285:202"/> that they kept it ≈øecret, becau≈øe being knowne, if it were not agreeable to all, it might be interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The
<hi>Duke</hi> vi≈øited the <hi>Count de Vaudemont,</hi> and comforted him with this aduice, promi≈øing him that the <hi>Secretary Padauin</hi> would returne contented. And calling Him to ≈øpeak with him vpon this aduice, fir≈øt he excu≈øed him≈øelfe for deferring to Treat with him, becau≈øe he was hindered by the <hi>Diet:</hi> then told him that from <hi>Rome</hi> and from
<hi>France</hi> he had certaine aduice that the Peace was vpon concluding. That the Preparations at <hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> were ≈ølackened, and ≈øo the occa≈øion of the Leuie cea≈øed. And how≈øoeuer hee had a charge to ≈øollicite it, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele≈ø≈øe things now being vpon termes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, he ought to ≈øurcea≈øe vntill he had further co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t. That his inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tion was very good, and that he would not deferre to prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe, but onely to ≈øpare them charges: praying him to repre≈øent vnto the
<hi>Republique</hi> this his good office and coun≈øell which he gaue with ≈øincerity. The <hi>Secretary</hi> thanked him, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all wi≈øhed him to con≈øider that oftentimes ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of Peace were ≈øcattered, which in effect vani≈øh into ≈ømoake; and that the <hi>Pope</hi> was then farthe≈øt off, when he ≈øeemed to be the neare≈øt;
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:17285:203"/> That the <hi>Republique</hi> hauing yeelded ≈øomething, in ≈øtead of being appea≈øed he required yet more: That the
<hi>Pope</hi> hauing publi≈øhed in <hi>Con≈øi≈øtory</hi> his finall re≈øolution to the Warre, vanting him≈øelfe of the A≈ø≈øi≈øtance of
<hi>Princes,</hi> and naming a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> this had made the
<hi>Republique</hi> to Arme for the common repo≈øe: That the diligence which the <hi>Count</hi> had te≈øtified of his willingne≈ø≈øe to ≈øerue them, had moued the <hi>Senate</hi> to ≈øend Him into <hi>Lorraine;</hi> That none knew better their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øities than the <hi>Republique</hi> them≈øelues, &amp; that his <hi>Highne≈ø≈øe</hi> ought to beleeue him, knowing well that the
<hi>Senate</hi> would not ca≈øt them≈øelues vpon needle≈ø≈øe expences. Wherefore it was not to the purpo≈øe to write vnto <hi>Venice</hi> that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie might be deferred, but rather to take ≈øuch order that he might write that their Souldiers were ready in the field. The <hi>Duke</hi> replied, that what he had ≈øaid of the Peace was vpon good ground, &amp; that he de≈øired this ≈øatisfaction that he would write according to his coun≈øell, e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ≈øince the indi≈øpo≈øition of the <hi>Count</hi> his Sonne might di≈øpen≈øe with his employment for ≈øome few dayes. Hereupon
<hi>Padauin</hi> con≈øented to write by an expre≈ø≈øe <hi>Currier,</hi> ≈øaying, he hoped that the <hi>Count</hi> being recouered, while≈øt they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:17285:203"/> an an≈øwer, would then take order to make the Leuy. To which the <hi>Duke</hi> an≈øwered nothing; and not with≈øtanding that many times, euen by interrogations, the <hi>Secretary</hi> was in≈øtant to haue an an≈øwer, whether the <hi>Count</hi> did ≈øeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly intend, as al≈øo the <hi>Duke</hi> his Father, to a≈ø≈øi≈øt them, yet he could draw nothing from them. The <hi>Count</hi> ≈øent to ≈øee whether the
<hi>Secretary</hi> were ≈øatisfied by the <hi>Duke;</hi> to whom He an≈øwered, That he was to attend his recouery, that they made prayers for his health at <hi>Venice,</hi> whither he had written, a≈ø≈øuring the
<hi>Republique</hi> of his ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice; which gaue the <hi>Count</hi> great comfort, and the <hi>Duke</hi> thanked <hi>Padauin,</hi> ≈øaying, That hee would acknowledge his Sonne owed his life vnto him.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Criuelli,</hi> Chamberlaine to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bauier,</hi> arriued at <hi>Nancy,</hi> bringing with him a
<hi>Breue</hi> from the <hi>Pope,</hi> by which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the in≈øtances made vnto the <hi>Count,</hi> to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw him≈øelfe from the Seruice of the
<hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</hi> He had Audience of all ≈øeuerally with contentment. The

Padauin</hi> apprehending the Negatiue ≈øo clearely, iudged it nece≈ø≈øarie to ≈øpeake plainly, and ≈øaid, That the reports of Peace were without ground; that if they had beene true, he ≈øhould not haue had ≈øo many
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:17285:206"/> Commandments ≈øo often reiterated to ≈øollicite them, and although the Peace might follow vpon the Treaty, yet the
<hi>Count</hi> denying the ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice which he owed, might render it difficult, becau≈øe the <hi>Pope</hi> hereby might be more hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: That the

And he adioyned, that the <hi>Duke</hi> hauing demanded ≈øo much re≈øpite, as they might write and receiue an≈øwer, he knew not
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:17285:207"/> how they could come to a refu≈øall without breach of word. The <hi>Duke</hi> an≈øwered, that he held the Peace for a≈ø≈øured, and euery houre ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to heare of the Conclu≈øion. After two houres audience, where pa≈ø≈øed many an≈øwers and replies on the one part and the other, the <hi>Duke</hi> continuing ≈øtill to ≈øay, that he expected the Conclu≈øion, <hi>Padauin</hi> told him, that if they re≈øolued to ≈øay nothing el≈øe they ≈øhould declare them≈øelues, that he might immediately depart to prouide el≈øe where for the ≈øeruice of his <hi>Prince,</hi> ≈øince he could obtaine nothing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> Them that were obliged. Vpon this the
<hi>Duke</hi> praied him to wait three or foure daies. The next morning
<hi>Padauin</hi> had audience of the <hi>Count,</hi> who at the fir≈øt fight told him, that he de≈øired death rather then to be in this e≈øtate, which hee neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued would haue hapned: That hee could not di≈ø≈øemble his griefe, for that he ≈øaw on the one ≈øide his owne engagement, and on the other the will of his Father, whom he dur≈øt not contradict: That the <hi>Breues</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> &amp; the pur≈øuits of many, e≈øpecially of the

               <pb n="387" facs="tcp:17285:207"/> had iu≈øt cau≈øe to complaine of him for the money which he had receiued, ≈øeeing he failed them in time of need; but he prote≈øted that it was not his fault, and praied <hi>Padauin</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale with him, and ≈øpake with ≈øuch affection that teares fell from him.
<hi>Padauin,</hi> comforted him and ≈øaid, That in aduer≈øitie it was needfull to v≈øe prudence, and that he mu≈øt complaine of the <hi>Pope</hi> who ≈øold away his reputation by meanes of his Father. Hee repeated vnto him the ≈øame things which he had ≈øaid to the <hi>Duke,</hi> with greater vehomence and confidence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting him to make a new tryall with his, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to take away all impediment, to the ≈øend that ≈øuch an action, which would blemi≈øh his honour, might not come to the knowledge of men. Vpon the≈øe words the <hi>Count</hi> promi≈øed to v≈øe all his power with the
<hi>Duke</hi> his Father, but withall remembred him that his Father by I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of his yeares was feeble in body and mind, and oppre≈ø≈øed with the ≈øugge≈øtions of diuers. <hi>Padauin</hi> ≈øaw well that all this was nought but artifices; wherefore hauing waited the foure daies, he demanded Audience to take his leaue, which they prolonged, to ≈øerue them≈øelues of time. But in the end being con≈øtrained to dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courer
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:17285:208"/> them≈øelues, the <hi>Count</hi> propo≈øed this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That a Leuie ≈øhould be made vpon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe that the men ≈øhould not ≈øerue again≈øt the <hi>Pope,</hi> and this onely to take away the ≈øcruple of the <hi>Duke</hi> his Father; obliging him≈øelfe that when once the ≈øouldiers were in <hi>Italy</hi> they ≈øhould obey the commandements of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique</hi> without re≈øeruation. This
<hi>Padauin</hi> would not accept, that he might not violate the Capitulation, which was to ≈øerue <hi>Contra quo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque.</hi> So he re≈øolued to pa≈ø≈øe into <hi>Suitzerland,</hi> pre≈øently after he was adui≈øed where he might finde the <hi>Deputies</hi> of the <hi>Cantons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> in the meane while during the≈øe Differences, neglected not any thing which might ≈øu≈øteine his Dignity. For hauing learned out of the writings of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa</hi> was a Law altogether conformable to that of <hi>Venice,</hi> which forbade
<hi>Eccle≈øiastiques</hi> to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha≈øe, he made in≈øtance that it might be reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Which the <hi>Republique</hi> readily obeyed, to doe a thing gratefull to his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe,</hi> and to ≈øhew that the reuocation of their <hi>Edicts</hi> made the yeare before, as we haue formerly ≈øaid, had proceeded from a free di≈øpo≈øition, beleeuing al≈øo hereby to render the cau≈øe of the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:17285:208"/> Republique</hi> more odious. And vpon the like in≈øtance of the <hi>Pope,</hi> they gaue aduice of this reuocation in
<hi>Spaine</hi> by their <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador,</hi> which was e≈øteemed in that
<hi>Court</hi> for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme affectation, whereby it appeared mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øtly that herein they would giue example not onely to <hi>Venice,</hi> but to

<hi>King</hi> had ≈øo great a de≈øire of the Agreement, that he praied

The <hi>Duke</hi> without expecting any further, publi≈øhed his voyage, and gaue order to his <hi>Court,</hi> to make ready.

And he an≈øwered <hi>Alincourt</hi> (who knowing this irre≈øolution of the <hi>Pope,</hi> the third day after the arriuall of the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> went to him to complaine of a rumor di≈øper≈øed in <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Affaire could not be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated, or at lea≈øt concluded on ≈øuch condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as the <hi>King</hi> his
<hi>Ma≈øter</hi> had obtained, and that this was to depriue his
<hi>Maie≈øtie</hi> of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of ≈øo great an enterpri≈øe and ≈øo much paines as he had taken,) that though hee were vexed with many conflicts, in ≈øuch ≈øort that for three daies ≈øpace he had beene in a perpetuall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hauing drawne from the <hi>Card. de Ioyeu≈øe</hi>
               <pb n="395" facs="tcp:17285:211"/> and the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador Ca≈øtillon</hi> nothing but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall words brought from the <hi>Venetians,</hi> he was not with≈øtanding re≈øolued to a Concord, proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that they ≈øhould make a new e≈ø≈øay for the returne of the <hi>Ie≈øuites.</hi> It is very certaine, that many <hi>Cardinals</hi> who did not like the <hi>Popes</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation in comming ≈øo ≈øpeedily vnto <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures,</hi> were then al≈øo di≈øplea≈øed that he ≈øhould reuoke them without obtaining his De≈øigne to make the <hi>Repub.</hi> ≈øubmit. And Some among≈øt them did not ≈øticke to mutine and combine, with re≈øolution to contradict him in <hi>Confistory,</hi> wherein they were incouraged by ≈øome who aimed totally to hinder the Agreement, and by others to preuent at lea≈øt the <hi>Card. de Ioyeu≈øe</hi> that he ≈øhould not be the Author of it. That which was particularly Treated at <hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> and by the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øadors</hi> of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> was not at all communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Venice;</hi> ≈øo that they knew nothing of the≈øe Negotiations, ≈øaue onely ≈øo much as the
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øadors Ca≈øtro</hi> &amp; <hi>Fre≈øne</hi> ≈øpake, and that which hath beene written by the <hi>Card. du Perron,</hi> and by the
<hi>Archbi≈øhop</hi> of <hi>Vrbin.</hi> For that which was ≈øaid by the two
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øadors,</hi> it ≈øhall be declared in due place. But the relations
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:17285:212"/> of the <hi>Cardinall</hi> and the
<hi>Archbi≈øhop</hi> imported, that it ≈øeemed vnto the <hi>Cardinall de Ioyeu≈øe</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Rome</hi> to negotiate and conclude the Agreement with the <hi>Pope,</hi> that there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther difficulty but that he could not promi≈øe the re≈øtoring of the <hi>Ie≈øuites,</hi> which for many rea≈øons was arde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tly de≈øired by his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe.</hi> That being a≈ø≈øembled in coun≈øell with the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador Alin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> and the
<hi>French Cardinals,</hi> they had decreed to repre≈øent this point vnto the
<hi>Pope</hi> with ≈øome temperament. That accordingly after he had ≈øpoken of other points and giuen good content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a manner vnto the <hi>Pope,</hi> he ≈øaid, That hee could not hope to obtaine by particular Treaty the re≈øtoring of the <hi>Ie≈øuites,</hi> but he knew a cour≈øe by meanes whereof without doubt their ree≈øtabli≈øhment might be obtained; which was, that his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> ≈øhould put in his hand a <hi>Breue</hi> with ab≈øolute power to reuoke the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures,</hi> which he would carry to
<hi>Venice,</hi> where hauing ≈øhewed his power he would tell them he had a charge to execute nothing but on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that the <hi>Ie≈øuites</hi> might be readmitted: And by this meanes he hoped that when they ≈øaw at
<hi>Venice</hi> that nothing el≈øe remained but this onely point, to accord all que≈øtions, they
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:17285:212"/> would re≈øolute to giue him this contentment.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> wel rudged that his Honor would be much impaired, if he abandoned the <hi>Ie≈øuites,</hi> who had beene cha≈øed (as he per≈øwaded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe) for their obedience to his <hi>Interdict;</hi> hauing al≈øo promi≈øed them that he would not encline to any Concord, but with condition that they ≈øhould be re≈øtored. Whereunto al≈øo was ioyned another point of his Reputation, That if for two Men of the <hi>Church</hi> impri≈øoned, he had made ≈øo much bruit in the World, it ≈øeemed to him that he ought much le≈ø≈øe to endure the bani≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a whole <hi>Order.</hi> But the <hi>Cardinall du Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> per≈øwaded at length the <hi>Pope,</hi> telling him that if this were the only point to hinder the Treaty, the generall Cau≈øe which was in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer≈øie, would become the particular cau≈øe of the <hi>Ie≈øuites,</hi> and not of the <hi>Apo≈øtolique See;</hi> adding, That fir≈øt of all it was meet to ree≈øtabli≈øh his owne Authority at
<hi>Venice,</hi> which being once ≈øetled, it would be ea≈øie by that means to re≈øtore there the <hi>Ie≈øuites:</hi> wherefore, not to name them in this Treaty, was not ab≈øolutely to exclude them, but only to deferre their re≈øtitution. To confirme his ≈øpeech, he called to minde the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of
<hi>Clement</hi> 8. who in the reconciliation
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:17285:213"/> of <hi>King Henry</hi> the fourth, notwith≈øtanding that he e≈øteemed highly that article of the returne of the
<hi>Ie≈øuites,</hi> yet ≈øeeing the difficulty of it, he was content to let it go, with hope to obtaine in due time what then ≈øeemed impo≈ø≈øible; in which hope he was not deceiued, hauing afterwards ea≈øily obtained what he de≈øired. The <hi>Pope</hi> was content that the <hi>Cardinall de Ioyeu≈øe</hi> ≈øhould doe all he could po≈ø≈øibly for the re≈øtitution of the <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuites,</hi> without in≈øi≈øting vpon that point, ≈øeeing he could not for that time pa≈ø≈øe further.</p>
            <p>But be≈øides this, three other difficulties cro≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed the Treaty of the <hi>Cardinall.</hi> The fir≈øt, becau≈øe the <hi>Pope</hi> would haue
<hi>Moun≈øieur de Fre≈øne,</hi> the <hi>French Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> at
<hi>Venice,</hi> demand by writing in the Name of the <hi>King,</hi> and of the
<hi>Republique,</hi> that the <hi>Cen≈øures</hi> might be taken away, ≈øo as
<hi>Don Inigo de Cardenas</hi> the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> had done: But the <hi>Mini≈øters</hi> of the <hi>French King</hi> would haue this done by <hi>M. d' Alincourt</hi> his <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈ø≈øador</hi> at
<hi>Rome,</hi> wherewith at length the <hi>Pope</hi> was contented. As al≈øo that the ≈øaid <hi>Cardinall,</hi> and <hi>M. d' Alincourt,</hi> ≈øhould giue him their word in the Name of the <hi>King,</hi> that the Lawes ≈øhould remaine without execution, vntill the Accord might be effected. This the
<hi>Pope</hi> did not like
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:17285:213"/> on this fa≈øhion, pretending that they ought to ≈øay, that it was with the con≈øent of the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,</hi> and vntill the Accord was effected. But the <hi>Cardinall de Ioyeu≈øe</hi> hauing not receiued here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon any word from the <hi>Republique,</hi> as hath bin ≈øaid, could not ≈øay that it was with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent. The Copies of the≈øe Propo≈øitions, made by <hi>Cardenas, Alincourt</hi> and
<hi>Ioyeu≈øe</hi> are ≈øcattered ouer the World, but how true or fal≈øe they are we cannot ≈øay, nothing of all this being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the
<hi>Republique,</hi> as al≈øo the <hi>Senate</hi> neuer gaue any word, excepting ≈øuch as hath beene formerly related.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it was the <hi>Popes</hi> will, that following the cu≈øtome of the <hi>Court,</hi> the <hi>Cen≈øures</hi> ≈øhould be taken away at <hi>Rome,</hi> beleeuing it an indignity (be≈øides the vnu≈øualne≈ø≈øe of the matter) which would much dimini≈øh his Reputation, and that he ≈øhould too farre aba≈øe him≈øelfe, if he ≈øhould ≈øend a <hi>Cardinall</hi> to this effect. But the <hi>Mini≈øters</hi> of <hi>France</hi> very well con≈øidered that this was to di≈ø≈øolue totally all that hitherto had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, becau≈øe without doubt at <hi>Rome</hi> many things would be propo≈øed by diuers Per≈øons to hinder and trauer≈øe the Affaire, and many new difficulties would be rai≈øed. And although all
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:17285:214"/> were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>cluded, yet nothing could be executed at <hi>Rome,</hi> but in ≈øuch forme as might argue the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> of
<hi>Venice</hi> to haue faulted. Now at <hi>Venice</hi> it was certaine, they would endure nothing in the world which might imply that the
<hi>Cen≈øures</hi> had beene valide. Wherefore the <hi>French,</hi> holding this point to be mo≈øt e≈ø≈øential, did ≈øo well work the <hi>Pope,</hi> that he yeelded no act ≈øhould pa≈ø≈øe in <hi>Rome.</hi> They de≈øired further, that in the fir≈øt <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtory</hi> his
<hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> would communicate to the <hi>Cardinals</hi> what had beene deliberated; but he con≈øented not to doe it, only in a priuate Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he ≈øpake with ≈øome thereof, with re≈øoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to call foure or ≈øix a day into his Chamber, and take their opinions each one a part.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> pre≈øuppo≈øed that the Pri≈øoners ≈øhould be rendered without Prote≈øtation; but hauing vnder≈øtood that at
<hi>Venice</hi> they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolued to Prote≈øt, he was vpon the point to breake off all, if the <hi>Cardinall du Perron</hi> had not per≈øwaded him to the contrary, ≈øaying, That if on this occa≈øion he ought to breake, it would be more aduantageous to his Dignity that he ≈øhould breake at <hi>Venice,</hi> for then the cau≈øe of this breach would be wholly a≈øcribed to the
<hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> whereas if he brake in <hi>Rome,</hi> it would be
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:17285:214"/> attributed to his ≈øtiffene≈ø≈øe. By this meanes the <hi>Pope</hi> being ≈øetled, pa≈ø≈øed by this difficulty.</p>
            <p>In the fir≈øt <hi>Con≈øi≈øtory</hi> which was made after the≈øe re≈øolutions, all the <hi>Cardinals</hi> were pre≈øent, euen tho≈øe who for their indi≈øpo≈øition were not accu≈øtomed to come but very rarely, a≈ø≈øuring them≈øelues that the <hi>Pope</hi> would communicate to them the re≈øolution which he had taken, and ≈øome among≈øt them were prepared to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict. But the <hi>Pope</hi> after he had Treated ≈øome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Con≈øi≈øtoriall matters, did not ≈øpeake hereof one word, only he heard them all in priuate Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience (for ≈øix dayes ≈øpace) ≈øpeaking to them of this Affaire, as of a thing already done. Some in their an≈øwers commended the action with many words, ≈øome with fewer; but ≈øome few oppo≈øed them≈øelues, and others to rai≈øe more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties repre≈øented new precautions. Some were of opinion that it was better to ≈øend the
<hi>Cardinall Borghe≈øe,</hi> and ≈øome others would haue the <hi>Cardinall Zapata</hi> ioyned with the <hi>Cardinall de Ioyeu≈øe.</hi> But the
<hi>Pope</hi> re≈øolued in him≈øelfe not to depart from his fir≈øt deliberation, nor from that which had beene concluded with <hi>Ioyeu≈øe.</hi> Now remained only the forme of the <hi>Breue,</hi> full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame difficulties, the Que≈øtion being at once
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:17285:215"/> to ≈øaue both the Dignity of the
<hi>Pope,</hi> and of the <hi>Senate:</hi> a thing ≈øo much the more hard and knotty, becau≈øe it was without all example of former times. For anciently the
<hi>Popes</hi> taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their <hi>Cen≈øures</hi> at the ≈øupplication of them that had beene Cen≈øured, were able, by in≈øerting in their
<hi>Breues</hi> their Repentance and acts of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility which they had v≈øed, to make them≈øelues formidable no le≈ø≈øe in their Pardons than in their Thunderings. But in this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, the ca≈øe was vtterly different, wherein they could not put one word to exalt the <hi>Popes</hi> actions, or in fauour of his <hi>Cen≈øures,</hi> but it would be ≈øufficient to breake the whole Treaty. Herein the <hi>Cardinall</hi> deui≈øed a new and prudent temper, which was, not to expedite any <hi>Breue,</hi> but to Treat all at
<hi>Venice</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by word of mouth, that he might not bring to
<hi>Venice</hi> any ≈øhadow of ≈øu≈øpition, and that it might be free to the
<hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to publi≈øh that the <hi>Pope</hi> herein had done all with his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage. Wherefore following this aduice, they dre≈ø≈øed only an In≈øtruction to the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> to be ≈øub≈øcribed with the
<hi>Popes</hi> hand. His <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> de≈øired al≈øo that ≈øome
<hi>Mini≈øters</hi> might a≈ø≈øi≈øt the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> to ≈øee the Actions pre≈øcribed in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction</hi> ob≈øerued, touching the con≈øignation
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:17285:215"/> of the Pri≈øoners, and the abolition of the
<hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures:</hi> and to receiue the Pri≈øoners was named <hi>Claudio Montano,</hi> a Criminall Iudge at <hi>Ferrara.</hi> There remained yet a
<hi>Notary</hi> to receiue the Acts, and to this effect were named many
<hi>Notaries</hi> of the <hi>Chamber,</hi> but none of them plea≈øed the
<hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall,</hi> who fore≈øaw what impediment the fa≈øhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the
<hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in ≈øuch Acts might bring to the execution of the Treaty. Wherefore he propo≈øed that <hi>Paul Catel,</hi> his Dome≈øticall
<hi>Chaplaine,</hi> might be created an <hi>Apo≈øtolique Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonotary,</hi> and employed as a <hi>Mini≈øter</hi> in the≈øe Actions which was accepted by the <hi>Pope,</hi> who was mo≈øt de≈øirous to winde him≈øelfe by any meanes out of this Labyrinth, and accordingly he created <hi>Catel</hi> a
<hi>Protonotary,</hi> and ≈øub≈øcribed the In≈øtruction for the
<hi>Cardinal,</hi> and di≈øpatched him, ≈øo as it was agreed. Of the≈øe Treaties they knew nothing at <hi>Venice,</hi> and as touching <hi>Paul Catel,</hi> when he came with the <hi>Cardinall</hi> he was neuer acknowledged for a <hi>Protonotary</hi> or <hi>Mini≈øter</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> nor did appeare in any other quality ≈øaue of the <hi>Caudatary</hi> (or Traine-bearer) of the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> neither was he euer ≈øeene to doe any other office. All this aboue-≈øaid hath beene ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Relations written from <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="404" facs="tcp:17285:216"/> But in <hi>Venice</hi> the two
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øadors</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> ≈øpake on another fa≈øhion, the 29. of <hi>March.</hi> The fir≈øt was <hi>Don Francis de Ca≈øtro,</hi> who brought newes that things went well at <hi>Rome,</hi> the
<hi>Pope</hi> being contented with the principall point executed by the
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador Aiton,</hi> who had giuen to his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> the word which he de≈øired in the Name of the <hi>Catholique King:</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning that if the <hi>Cardinall de Ioyeu≈øe</hi> had done the like, the≈øe Two had giuen the main ≈øtroke to the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe. He ≈øaid al≈øo that he liked well that the election of an <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> ≈øhould follow vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the reuocation of the <hi>Cen≈øures.</hi> And for the point of the
<hi>Ie≈øuits,</hi> that there would be no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, if they would ≈øpeake clearely in that of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing word for the Su≈øpen≈øion of the Lawes: but the
<hi>Pope</hi> was con≈øtant in his re≈øolution, ≈øaying, That in tho≈øe things which he de≈øired, men v≈øed guilded or di≈øgui≈øed words, but in tho≈øe which others willed, they ≈øpake clearely. To this the <hi>Duke</hi> replied pre≈øently, that the <hi>Senate</hi> had ≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken clearely, yea mo≈øt clearely, and that they did not intend to be obliged to any thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond or be≈øides that which they had expre≈øly ≈øaid.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> of <hi>France</hi> after him repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:17285:216"/> that the <hi>Cardinall</hi> being arriued at
<hi>Rome,</hi> had found the <hi>Pope</hi> informed in all that which he purpo≈øed to propound, hauing knowne it fir≈øt by others, and that hereupon his Holine≈ø≈øe was much cooled. That the <hi>Pope</hi> at length di≈øcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him how that <hi>Don Francis de Ca≈øtro</hi> had di≈øpatched foure <hi>Curriers,</hi> one after another, with adui≈øe that the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> had not receiued any more ample word then him≈øelfe, &amp; that the ≈øame things which he had obtained of the <hi>Republique</hi> were to be ≈øeene in <hi>Rome</hi> in writing. That hee had nothing but generall words, which did not onely not conclude that which his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> pretended, but euen the contrary: whereby they might ≈øee that the voyage of the <hi>Cardinall</hi> had not any ≈øolid foundation. But that the
<hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall</hi> for all this, after he had ≈øuffered the <hi>Pope</hi> to ≈øay what he plea≈øed, had giuen him ≈øo good ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, that he was appea≈øed: and already all had been fini≈øhed, had it not been for that point of the <hi>Ie≈øuites,</hi> which the <hi>Pope</hi> maruellou≈øly vrged. That his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> was contented with the word giuen him in the name of the <hi>King</hi> by the <hi>Cardinall</hi> and <hi>Alincourt,</hi> although he knew that they had it not from the <hi>Republique.</hi> But neuerthele≈ø≈øe per≈øeuering in his de≈øire to haue
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:17285:217"/> the <hi>Ie≈øuites</hi> ree≈øtabli≈øhed, the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> knew not how to auoid it, but re≈øted in ≈øome feare le≈øt the re≈øolution hereof might cau≈øe delay in the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>The day following <hi>Don Francis de Ca≈øtro</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the
<hi>Duke</hi> to bring Newes, that by a <hi>Currier</hi> di≈øpatched vnto him with diligence fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the <hi>Marquis d'Aiton,</hi> he was aduerti≈øed, that the impediment concerning the <hi>Ie≈øuites</hi> was taken away; for as much as the <hi>Pope,</hi> who till then had bin firme in his re≈øolution rather to breake, hauing heard the rea≈øons which he who ≈øpake had cau≈øed to be repre≈øented by a Gentleman ≈øent po≈øt to <hi>Rome,</hi> was in the end contented to let goe that point in gratification of the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>Spaine</hi> and of him≈øelfe. That the difficulties had been great, and he knew not whether other had helped to ≈øurmount them; but he prayed that in recompence they would accord him a Su≈øpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of the Lawes for a time. Whereupon <hi>Don Francis</hi> di≈øcour≈øed with much skill and artifice, ≈øometime demanding it in con≈øideration of the <hi>Pope,</hi> ≈øometime to gratifie him≈øelfe, and ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in fauour of the <hi>King</hi> his
<hi>Ma≈øter.</hi> Adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for conclu≈øion, that at lea≈øt they ≈øhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord it till his departure. But the <hi>Duke</hi> remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:17285:217"/> con≈øtant in the an≈øwer giuen before, hee ≈øhewed a de≈øire that this his propo≈øition might be communicated to the
<hi>Senate.</hi> Wherefore vpon the morrow the <hi>Senate</hi> decreed to giue him an≈øwer, with thanks for that which he had done in the exclu≈øion of the
<hi>Ie≈øuites,</hi> adioyning that for the re≈øt, hauing ≈øaid all that was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, they thought it not nece≈ø≈øary to adde any thing further.</p>
            <p>But the 2. of <hi>Aprill</hi> following, the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> of <hi>France</hi> brought the <hi>Newes</hi> of an entire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion of the Agreement, ≈øaying, that the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall</hi> him≈øelfe in Per≈øon would bring the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. Yet vnder≈øtanding that ≈øome others had di≈øpatched a
<hi>Currier,</hi> he was willing to doe the ≈øame. And that the <hi>Pope</hi> had put ≈øo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in him, that not harkning to the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitions of others, he was content to giue him power to take away the
<hi>Cen≈øures,</hi> which hee would accordingly execute vpon his arriuall at
<hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fir≈øt care of the <hi>Cardinall</hi> after the Peace concluded, was to giue aduice thereof vnto the <hi>King</hi> who had ≈øent him: but after this, he de≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nothing more then to aduerti≈øe the

<pb n="408" facs="tcp:17285:218"/> him to this purpo≈øe, as becau≈øe hee knew how much it imported the <hi>Pope</hi> that all Leuies of men beyond the

<hi>Currier,</hi> with Letters from the <hi>Cardinall de Ioyeu≈øe</hi> and from the great <hi>Duke.</hi> Adioyning, that (without re≈øpect to the
<hi>Pope,)</hi> he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that the Leuie might be made, excu≈øing the negatiue which had pa≈ø≈øed, vpon re≈øpects of Con≈øcience and of Religion: as al≈øo for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øts of <hi>State,</hi> which cau≈øed his
<hi>Hou≈øe</hi> to be ≈øtraitly vnited to the <hi>Church,</hi> be≈øides the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine hope which he alwaies had of this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, without which peraduenture hee had not beene moued. <hi>Padauin</hi> ≈øaid but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, to iu≈øtifie the actions of the <hi>Republique,</hi> and to condemne the
<hi>Eccle≈øia≈øtiques,</hi> who aimed at a fourth <hi>Crowne</hi> by ≈øubmitting <hi>Princes</hi> vnto them≈øelues. The <hi>Duke</hi> ≈øaid, matters were now to be executed not deliberated, not knowing before that
<hi>Republiques</hi> could not better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for their gouernment then by good Lawes. The <hi>Count de Vaudemont</hi> te≈øtified herein very much contentment, and promi≈øed <hi>Padauin</hi> to
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:17285:218"/> begin the Leuie immediatly after
<hi>Ea≈øter,</hi> adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that it were good to cau≈øe the
<hi>Sui≈ø≈øes</hi> to pa≈ø≈øe fir≈øt, the better to facilitate the pa≈ø≈øage for the <hi>Lorraines. Padauin</hi> perceiued very well that the De≈øigne of the <hi>Count</hi> in making the Leuie was to couer the lo≈ø≈øe of his reputation, and to obtaine of the <hi>Republique</hi> to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the charge of <hi>Generall</hi> of their Armies. Wherof He was further a≈ø≈øured, when <hi>Monfieur de Vadiot</hi> told him, that the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> had offred the <hi>Count</hi> 15000. Crownes by the yeare to draw him to the feruice of their <hi>King,</hi> to which he ≈øaid the
<hi>Count</hi> would not giue care, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination which he had to ≈øerue the <hi>Republique.</hi> And that in the former pa≈ø≈øage of matters he had re≈øerued him≈øelfe, le≈øt his Father ≈øhould di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduantage him in his Te≈øtament: but it was not meet to thinke the like of his Brother, who had his E≈øtate proper and ≈øeuerall, which might haue ≈øufficed for the Leuie which was de≈øired. <hi>Vadiot</hi> added, that although the Leuy had not beene made intirely before the conclu≈øion of Peace, notwith≈øtanding that which was done already had giuen reputation to the <hi>Republique.</hi> He ≈øaid further in particular, that the <hi>Duke</hi> had neuer con≈øented to ratifie the Leuie, vnle≈ø≈øe that
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:17285:219"/> clau≈øe were taken away, <hi>Contra quo≈øcunque.</hi> But <hi>Padauin</hi> being well certified of the conclu≈øion of Peace by certaine aduice which he had from the <hi>Court</hi> of the <hi>Most Chri≈øtian King,</hi> deferred to deliuer the ≈øiluer appointed for the Leuy, vntill he were fir≈øt a≈ø≈øured of the pa≈ø≈øage of the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons.</hi> In this meane while, neither <hi>Padauin</hi> nor any of his <hi>Hou≈øe</hi> were admitted to Confe≈ø≈øion by any Confe≈ø≈øor at <hi>Nancy,</hi> by the cunning ≈øleights of the
<hi>Ie≈øuites:</hi> but this Newes of the Accord being come, the
<hi>Rector</hi> of the <hi>Ie≈øuites</hi> ≈øent to him to excu≈øe him≈øelfe, offering to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him to Confe≈ø≈øion if he would promi≈øe to doe nothing again≈øt the <hi>Pope.</hi> To whom he an≈øwered, that hauing hitherto learned nothing in their Schoole, he would not now begin in this Ca≈øe.</p>
            <p>Likewi≈øe in <hi>Spaine</hi> the certaine Newes of the Agreement being arriued before <hi>Ea≈øter,</hi> the <hi>Popes Nuntio</hi> adui≈øed the
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> that he ≈øhould ab≈øtaine from the Communion at <hi>Ea≈øter,</hi> con≈øidering that ≈øhortly after he might be pre≈øent with the <hi>Popes</hi> permi≈ø≈øion. But the
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> would not receiue this coun≈øell: on the contrary, he was confe≈ø≈øed and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon holy <hi>Thur≈øday</hi> by
<hi>Francis Spino≈øa</hi> a
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:17285:219"/> 
               <hi>Dominican, Prior</hi> of our <hi>Lady de Zocchia,</hi> hauing carried the Canopy ouer the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> and being admitted to all the <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øticall.</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of that day, and euen to dinner with the <hi>Friars.</hi> And it is likely that that
<hi>Father</hi> did not this without the iudgement and con≈øent of other
<hi>Doctors,</hi> not onely <hi>Theologues</hi> which taught him this, but al≈øo of other profe≈ø≈øions, without whom in the <hi>Court</hi> of ≈øo great a <hi>King,</hi> none dare vndertake ≈øuch enterpri≈øes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cardinall</hi> de≈øirous to bring his Treaty to an end, and hoping more ea≈øily to obtaine ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more for the <hi>Popes</hi> aduantage during tho≈øe <hi>Fe≈øtiuall</hi> daies then at other times, made his iourney wth ≈øuch ha≈øte, that in his pa≈ø≈øage by Sea from
<hi>Ancona</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> he expo≈øed his life to hazard. He arriued on Munday in the Holy Weeke, with great de≈øire to fini≈øh the Concord before the <hi>Fea≈øt.</hi> But the Affaire would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ≈øo ≈øpeedy expedition, and the <hi>Senate</hi> (who knew well their owne innocence,) did not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteeme it meet to ha≈øten matters, being a≈ø≈øured they were as able and fit to participate in <hi>Diuine Seruices</hi> before the Conclu≈øion as after it. The day following, which was the 10. of <hi>Aprill,</hi> the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> went to the <hi>Senate,</hi> and declared to
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:17285:220"/> them his charge, not making mention of any
<hi>Breue</hi> which he had from the <hi>Pope;</hi> and already men knew that he had nothing el≈øe but an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction ≈øub≈øcribed with the hand of his
<hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈ø≈øe.</hi> The <hi>Senate</hi> gaue credit to the power, which he ≈øaid he had from the <hi>Pope,</hi> (as being one of the prime
<hi>Cardinals</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and a Mini≈øter of the <hi>Mo≈øt Chri≈øtian King,)</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ≈øhewing any writings from the
<hi>Pope</hi> at all. He certified fir≈øt the <hi>Repub.</hi> of the
<hi>Popes</hi> good will, and his right intentions carried vnto the publique good of <hi>Chri≈øtendome,</hi> excu≈øing the ≈øtiffne≈ø≈øe which he had ≈øhewed in the Treaty, as proceeding from a zeale to ≈øu≈øtaine the
<hi>Papall</hi> dignity. But that, for all the good inclination of his
<hi>Holine≈ø≈øe,</hi> the Affaire had beene very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to conclude, not without danger of a breach, by rea≈øon of the euill offices done by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers per≈øons. That in the end the difficulties were re≈øtrained to two: the one, to ≈øend an <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈ø≈øador</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> before the
<hi>Cen≈øures</hi> were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; the other, to ree≈øtabli≈øh the
<hi>Ie≈øuites.</hi> That the former was ea≈øily ended, the <hi>Pope</hi> being contented that the <hi>Cen≈øures</hi> ≈øhould fir≈øt be taken away: but the ≈øecond was not in ≈øuch ≈øort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, but that he mu≈øt ≈øpeake more thereof
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:17285:220"/> with his <hi>Serenity.</hi> Then he pa≈ø≈øed to explane the Conditions and the forme, how the <hi>Cen≈øures</hi> were to be taken away. The Conditions were; That the <hi>Religious</hi> gone forth of the
<hi>State</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of the <hi>Interdict</hi> ≈øhould be re≈øtored, and their goods redeliuered. That the Pri≈øoners ≈øhould bee con≈øigned without prote≈øting: That the Prote≈øtation of the <hi>Republique</hi> ≈øhould be reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, with al that had followed, as al≈øo the <hi>Letter</hi> writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> vnto the Cities of the <hi>State,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per≈øed. He made veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t in≈øta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce for the ree≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t of the
<hi>Ie≈øuites,</hi> a≈ø≈øuring them not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding that he could take away the <hi>Cen≈øures</hi> without this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>dition, but v≈øing words very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwa≈øiue &amp; ful of affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, he ≈øaid, that this would make an entire Agreement, as a thing de≈øired by the <hi>Pope</hi> for his reputation, by the <hi>Mo≈øt Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an King,</hi> for the ≈øatisfaction of his
<hi>Holine≈ø≈øe,</hi> and to him (who ≈øpake) more deare than the gaine of a
<hi>Kingdome,</hi> for the ≈øame Rea≈øons: That he would coun≈øell the
<hi>Republique</hi> to doe it, that they might ≈øettle a firme and durable Peace. The <hi>Duke</hi> and the <hi>Colledge</hi> immediatly an≈øwered, that the re≈øolution to giue the Pri≈øoners to the <hi>King</hi> to gratifie him, without preiudice of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the <hi>Republique</hi> had beene accepted by his
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:17285:221"/> 
               <hi>Maie≈øty,</hi> and therefore could not now be called into doubt: al≈øo that he ≈øhould not hope in any manner to obtaine from the <hi>Senate</hi> the omitting of the Prote≈øtation, as al≈øo the re≈øtitution of the <hi>Ie≈øuites</hi> was a thing meerely impo≈ø≈øible, becau≈øe of the great iniuries at all times receiued from them, and for the ≈øtrait conditions with which their Bani≈øhment had beene decreed. After this, the <hi>Cardinall</hi> pa≈ø≈øed to ≈øpeake of the forme of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the <hi>Cen≈øures,</hi> wherein there was ≈øome difficulty; For the <hi>Cardinall</hi> a≈ø≈øuring him≈øelfe that the <hi>Republique</hi> would remaine mo≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant in the confe≈ø≈øion of their innocence, and affirmatiuely maintaine that they had not in any ≈øort what≈øoeuer incurred the <hi>Cen≈øures,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly that they were re≈øolued to refu≈øe Ab≈øolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becau≈øe they had no need of it, would yet at lea≈øt doe ≈øome action by which he might make the World beleeue that the <hi>Duke</hi> had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it. And to this effect he propo≈øed, to goe to the Church of
<hi>S. Marke,</hi> with the <hi>Duke</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators,</hi> and there to celebrate or a≈ø≈øi≈øt at a <hi>Ma≈ø≈øe</hi> ≈øolemne or priuate, and in fine to giue a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, ≈øaying, that by this his action of cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating before the <hi>Prince,</hi> or of a≈ø≈øi≈øting with him at a
<hi>Ma≈ø≈øe,</hi> Men might ≈øee clearely that the
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:17285:221"/> 
               <hi>Cen≈øures</hi> had beene taken away, by the Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which he had giuen. This forme plea≈øed not, becau≈øe it had ≈øome ≈øemblance of an Ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, whence men might infer that the
<hi>Prince</hi> confe≈ø≈øed he had beene faulty. And the <hi>Duke</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered in plaine termes, that as the innocence of him≈øelfe and the
<hi>Republique</hi> was manife≈øt, and without ≈øhadow of fault, ≈øo it was meet there ≈øhould not appeare any ≈øigne of Repentance, of Remi≈ø≈øion, or Ab≈øolution. That it was well knowne what had happened to many
<hi>Princes</hi> on other occa≈øions, to whom ≈øome acts which they had done out of deuotion and Religion, had beene imputed and e≈øteemed to be ≈øo many acknowledgements of their faults. And that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily they carried in triumph the Conquered, and not ≈øuch as had ≈øtoutly defended by lawfull meanes the Authoritie giuen them by <hi>God.</hi> And when the <hi>Cardinall</hi> ≈øaid, that the <hi>Apo≈øtolique</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction ought not at any time, or in any ca≈øe to be refu≈øed by tho≈øe who had it offered; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer was made him, that this was true, and that the <hi>Republique</hi> had neuer refu≈øed it, nor were purpo≈øed to refu≈øe it, vnle≈ø≈øe when it gaue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion to beleeue a fal≈øity; as in the pre≈øent ca≈øe, men might be hence occa≈øioned to beleeue that
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:17285:222"/> the <hi>Republique</hi> had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mitted ≈øome fault, a thing contrary to truth, being mo≈øt a≈ø≈øured of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides this which was Treated that day by the <hi>Card.</hi> for the ≈øpace of foure daies, they ≈øent to him two <hi>Senators</hi> of the
<hi>Colledge,</hi> who treated vpon the points in que≈øtion, and vpon others which had ≈øome difficulty, touching the forme of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the
<hi>Cen≈øures.</hi> The <hi>Senators</hi> ≈øaid, that to the
<hi>Republique</hi> the word of the <hi>Card.</hi> would ≈øuffice. Concerning the Re≈øtitution of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious</hi> which were retired, they con≈øented ≈øo that it might be reciprocal, and made with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that the
<hi>Pope</hi> al≈øo ≈øhould receiue to grace them, who had per≈øi≈øted in the Seruice of the <hi>Signiory.</hi> For the Writings, they ≈øaid, the
<hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> would do with tho≈øe which had been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øhed in their fauour, as the <hi>Pope</hi> ≈øhould do with his. And as for the
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador,</hi> after that the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures</hi> were taken away, they would elect and ≈øend one to re≈øide according to the Cu≈øtome. For their <hi>Manife≈øto,</hi> that in like manner they would take it away, after that the <hi>Monitorie,</hi> whereupon it was grounded, were taken away. And touching the <hi>Letter</hi> written to the <hi>Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> and Commonalties, that many <hi>Letters</hi> had
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:17285:222"/> beene writ according to the exigence of affaires, but that they were ≈øecret, neither was it rea≈øona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any ≈øhould giue Law to a <hi>Prince</hi> what he ought to write to his
<hi>Mini≈øters</hi> and Subiects. That the <hi>Letter</hi> commonly ≈øcattered was fal≈øe, therefore it was not needfull to ≈øpeake of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides that it was vnder the Dignity of a <hi>Prince</hi> to Treat about forged Writings. Touching the <hi>Ie≈øuites,</hi> that to ≈øpeake of their returne, was to put all that which had beene done in confu≈øion, in as much as for certaine the finall re≈øolution of the <hi>Senate</hi> was, that they ≈øhould be excluded.</p>
            <p>On the other ≈øide, the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> ≈øaying he had charge from the <hi>King</hi> to con≈øerue in effect the Libertie of the
<hi>Republique,</hi> and in appearance the Dignity of the <hi>Pope,</hi> endeuoured to per≈øwade the <hi>Senate</hi> to receiue a Benediction, not for Ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, but as an ordinary Benediction, ≈øuch as the <hi>Pope</hi> ≈øendeth. For the Writings and their Authors, he ≈øaid, he would not yeeld any thing in fauour of the <hi>Republique,</hi> becau≈øe (≈øaid he) they are matters for the <hi>Inqui≈øition,</hi> wherein the <hi>Pope</hi> him≈øelfe cannot intermeddle. He propo≈øed further, that they ≈øhould ≈øend not one, but two <hi>Amba≈ø≈øadors,</hi> con≈øidering that this grace done by the
<hi>Pope</hi> merited an extraordinary thank≈øgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:17285:223"/> He pre≈ø≈øed al≈øo, that they ≈øhould publi≈øh a <hi>Manife≈øto</hi> wth might reuoke the former, before the
<hi>Cen≈øures</hi> were taken away. For the <hi>Letter</hi> which had been diuulged, how≈øoeuer it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, yet ≈øome mention might be made that it was ≈øuch by that act. Further, he propo≈øed, that it was meet to frame a Writing which ≈øhould containe the points which were accorded, ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had brought a Formulary from <hi>Rome,</hi> without making any mention of the
<hi>Ie≈øuites.</hi> For ≈øince they were not ree≈øtabli≈øhed, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion at lea≈øt ought not to be ≈øpecified; yet if this point ≈øhould ≈øeeme ≈øo important, as it ought not to remaine ambiguous, that at lea≈øt the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their exclu≈øion might be conceiued in as faire termes as was po≈ø≈øible. But for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtation vpon the deliuery of the Pri≈øoners, the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador Fre≈øne</hi> decided the difficulty, ≈øaying, that they were for the <hi>King,</hi> and to him, as to his <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador,</hi> they ought to be con≈øigned; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he would be contented to receiue them with the Prote≈øtation which the <hi>Republique</hi> ≈øhould make, wherein the <hi>Pope</hi> nor any others were to intermeddle.</p>
            <p>The other difficulties were againe examined in full <hi>Senate</hi> the fourteenth of the ≈øame <hi>Month,</hi>
               <pb n="419" facs="tcp:17285:223"/> and then Treated with the <hi>Cardinall</hi> the three dayes following; and at length all re≈øolued af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner;</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Cardinall</hi> ≈øhould declare in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, without any other Ceremonie, that the <hi>Cen≈øures</hi> were taken away, or that hee tooke them away, (a thing which might be done ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthele≈ø≈øe, though they were iudged inualide:) And at the ≈øame time the <hi>Duke</hi> ≈øhould put in his hands a reuocation of the Prote≈øtation. They concluded al≈øo vpon the forme of con≈øigning the Pri≈øoners according to the aduice of <hi>Fre≈øne;</hi> that not any act ≈øhould be dre≈ø≈øed vpon the points of the Agreement; but that the word of the <hi>Republique</hi> on the one ≈øide, and of the <hi>Card.</hi> on the other, ≈øhould ≈øuffice. The ree≈øtabli≈øhment of the <hi>Religious</hi> which had retired them≈øelues was decreed, the <hi>Ie≈øuites</hi> notwith≈øtanding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining excluded, and be≈øides fourteene others of the <hi>Religious</hi> who fled not for obedience to the <hi>Pope,</hi> but to auoid the puni≈øhment of their crimes, it being a matter of Iu≈øtice that Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous per≈øons ≈øhould be bani≈øhed the
<hi>State.</hi> That no mention ≈øhould be made of any Letter writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vnto Gouernours, but onely a <hi>Manife≈øto</hi> publi≈øhed for the reuocation of the Prote≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:17285:224"/> which was imprinted. And after that the
<hi>Cen≈øures</hi> were taken away, that they ≈øhould name an
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> to re≈øide with his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe.</hi> For other particularities that they ≈øhould not then be ≈øpoken of, but ≈øhould be remitted to be fairely Treated with the <hi>Pope.</hi> There remained only the forme of the <hi>Manife≈øto,</hi> to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe to agree vpon the termes, the <hi>Secretarie Marc Ottobon</hi> was ≈øent to the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> &amp; <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øieur de Fre≈øne,</hi> who ea≈øily con≈øented vpon a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, ≈øaue only vpon tho≈øe words where it was ≈øaid, That <hi>the Cen≈øures being taken away, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtation in like manner was taken away:</hi> the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi> vrging that they ought not to v≈øe the word <hi>taken away</hi> in the Prote≈øtation, but <hi>reuoked,</hi> which the <hi>Secretary</hi> would not yeeld, and reported the matter vnto the
<hi>Colledge.</hi> Who though they could not comprehend what ≈øubtilty might be intended in the word <hi>Reuoked,</hi> which the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall</hi> would v≈øe, rather than that other <hi>Taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> notwith≈øtanding this latter plea≈øed them better, becau≈øe it was v≈øed on both parts, the word
<hi>Taken away,</hi> being employed both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the <hi>Cen≈øures,</hi> and of the Prote≈øtation. But the <hi>Cardinall</hi> declaring that he could not herein goe beyond his charge which he had from the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:17285:224"/> 
               <hi>Pope,</hi> and the <hi>Senate</hi> perceiuing not any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, le≈øt they ≈øhould ≈øeeme to deny it only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they were in≈øtantly reque≈øted, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈øcended in the end that the word of <hi>Reuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> ≈øhould be v≈øed. And to ≈øhew that all was done in one and the ≈øame time, it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to ≈øay, <hi>The Prote≈øtation in like manner is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked.</hi> All the≈øe particularities being thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and determined, and the <hi>Manife≈øto</hi> dre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, they appointed the day the 21. of <hi>Aprill,</hi> to giue an entire accompli≈øhment to that which was determined, which was done in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner following.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cardinall</hi> was lodged in the Palace (≈øometime) of the

            <p>
               <pb n="423" facs="tcp:17285:225"/> This Act thus fini≈øhed, the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> departed with the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador,</hi> and both went vnto the <hi>Prince,</hi> who after <hi>Ma≈ø≈øe</hi> was gone with the

<q>I reioyce very much that this happy day ≈øo much de≈øired by me is come, wherein I declare vnto your <hi>Serenitie</hi> that all the

<hi>Chri≈øtendome,</hi> and particularly to <hi>Italy.</hi> Then the
<hi>Duke</hi> put in his hand the decree of the reuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prote≈øtation.</q> And after ≈øome words of complement, the
<hi>Cardinall</hi> praied them to ≈øend their <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> with ≈øpeed to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ≈øo departed.</p>
            <p>The reuocation of the Prote≈øtation was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre≈ø≈øed vnto the ≈øame Prelates to whom the Prote≈øtation was directed, and in ≈øub≈øtance contained, That a means being found, whereby the <hi>Pope</hi> was certified of the vprightne≈ø≈øe and ≈øincerity of the <hi>Republique</hi> in their actions, He had taken away and remoued the cau≈øes of the pre≈øent differences: And al≈øo, as the <hi>Senate</hi> had endeuoured alwaies to entertaine a good intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:17285:226"/> with the <hi>Holy See,</hi> ≈øo they receiued much contentment by obtaining the effect of this their iu≈øt de≈øire, whereof they were willing to giue them notice: adioyning, that on both ≈øides all being executed which had been agreed on, and the <hi>Cen≈øures</hi> being taken away, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtation in like ≈øort did remaine reuoked.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cardinall</hi> had determined after the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the
<hi>Prince,</hi> to goe to the <hi>Cathedrall Church</hi> of <hi>S.

Wherefore many <hi>Ma≈øses</hi> were celebrated from morning till Mid-day, as al≈øo the dayes before, both in that Church and in others, there was a great fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentation of <hi>Ma≈ø≈øes</hi> and other Diuine Offices, praying
<hi>God</hi> that what was Treated for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating of ≈øo great a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>trouer≈øie, might ≈øucceed to his glory. The <hi>Cardinall</hi> going from the Colledge, tooke his way to <hi>S. Peters,</hi> and at the ≈øame time the
<hi>Count de Ca≈øtro</hi> went to the Audience of the <hi>Prince</hi> to congratulate with him. In the meane while, the <hi>Cardinall</hi> arriued at the <hi>Cathedrall Church,</hi> where for the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:17285:226"/> of people they celebrated at three
<hi>Altars,</hi> and expected a while the comming of <hi>Don Francis de Ca≈øtro</hi> with <hi>Don Innigo de Cardenas,</hi> alwaies continuing
<hi>Ma≈ø≈øe</hi> after <hi>Ma≈ø≈øe.</hi> At length the
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øadors</hi> being come, the <hi>Cardinall</hi> ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated in the pre≈øence of an infinite mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
            <p>The ≈øame day, after dinner a bruit was ≈øcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, that that morning in the Colledge the <hi>Cardinall</hi> had giuen an ab≈øolution; which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed a great di≈øcontentment to ≈øuch as were zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the publique Honour, who were curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous quickly to di≈øcouer the originall of ≈øuch a bruit, with de≈øigne to haue a remedy, (≈øo fixed was that re≈øolution in the ≈øpirits of the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> to ≈øhew con≈øtantly that the
<hi>Republique</hi> was not in any fault:) but this rumour was ≈øuddenly appea≈øed, becau≈øe in ≈øeeking whence it might ari≈øe, they found it had beene ≈øcattered here and there by the <hi>French,</hi> who ≈øaid, that all the <hi>Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> of the Colledge being a≈ø≈øembled, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, according to the cu≈øtome, that the <hi>Duke</hi> ≈øhould fir≈øt ≈øit downe, then after all to take their place in order, the <hi>Cardinall</hi> made the ≈øigne of the <hi>Cro≈ø≈øe</hi> vnder his hood. Which being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood, the generall di≈øcontent was turned
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:17285:227"/> into merriment, for as much as none is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that if this be admitted as an Ab≈øolution, the
<hi>Eccle≈øia≈øtiques</hi> may giue Ab≈øolution from their
<hi>Cen≈øures</hi> euen to them which refu≈øe it, or wch do not de≈øire it, that none can hinder it, that they may al≈øo (following this doctrine) ab≈øolue men ab≈øent, &amp; as it ≈øhall ≈øeeme good vnto them: That if the
<hi>Card.</hi> made the ≈øigne of the Cro≈ø≈øe vnder his hood, he might haue done it more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiou≈øly in his Lodging, this importing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpo≈øe. It was ≈øufficient that the <hi>Interdict</hi> had not beene ob≈øerued for any one moment, and that the <hi>Senate</hi> refu≈øed not onely ab≈øolution, but euen all ceremonies which might haue the lea≈øt apparence thereof.</p>
            <p>In the euening of the ≈øame day the <hi>Senate</hi> a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembled, where they deliberated to elect an <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈ø≈øador</hi> to goe to
<hi>Rome,</hi> to re≈øide with his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe:</hi> and <hi>Francis Contarini</hi> a Knight was ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, who had beene ≈øent by the
<hi>Republique</hi> ≈øome yeeres before, with three others, to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate with this <hi>Pope</hi> for his a≈ø≈øumption to the <hi>Papacie.</hi> Thus was ended this tumultuous Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire, which ≈øeemed impo≈ø≈øible to be compo≈øed by Accord: and verily a great part of the good ≈øucce≈ø≈øe ought to be a≈øcribed to the dexterity of
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:17285:227"/> the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> who omitting pointilles and ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties, did not ≈øay at <hi>Venice</hi> all that which the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> had wi≈øhed, whereunto he ≈øaw clearely they would neuer haue con≈øented.</p>
            <p>Many were of opinion that it was meet to ≈øend Extraordinary
<hi>Amba≈ø≈øadors</hi> into <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> to thanke tho≈øe <hi>Kings</hi> who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpo≈øed and employed them≈øelues for an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, e≈øpecially con≈øidering the quality of the Mini≈øters whom they had herein v≈øed, whereof the one was very eminent, as being the mo≈øt ancient <hi>Cardinall,</hi> the other as <hi>Nephew</hi> of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lerma.</hi> This aduice plea≈øed the general, as being grounded vpon termes of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and acknowledgment of obligation. Wherefore the
<hi>Senate</hi> put it in deliberation, where balancing the rea≈øons which incouraged to doe this, with others which di≈ø≈øwaded it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe it was to giue too much reputation to the Affaire, and to make the world beleeue that the <hi>Republique</hi> thought them≈øelues well deliuered from a merited danger; this ≈øole re≈øpect had ≈øo much weight, that they re≈øolued all with one voice, that it would ≈øuffice to doe ≈øuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement by the ordinary <hi>Amba≈ø≈øadors.</hi> Likewi≈øe many expected in <hi>Venice</hi> they ≈øhould make bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:17285:228"/> and other ≈øignes of ioy, or at lea≈øt ring their bells: Notwith≈øtanding, nothing of this was done, nor one bell founded neither at <hi>Venice</hi> nor in any Citie of the <hi>State</hi> when the News arriued. Not that the <hi>Senate</hi> and the Cities of the <hi>State</hi> were not very glad to be freed from the danger<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> of Warre, but to the end that ≈øuch ≈øignes of ioy might not be interpreted to ≈øignifie ≈øome ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution which they had receiued, or the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> thereby conceiued to haue beene formerly in a fault; which, as an vntruth and fal≈øhood, they euer abhorred.</p>
            <p>Moreouer by order of <hi>Senate</hi> aduice was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of this Agreement, and of all that had pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, to the <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> and to the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters</hi> of the <hi>Republique</hi> in all <hi>Courts,</hi> and to the <hi>Gouernours</hi> of Cities in the
<hi>State,</hi> and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Secretary Padauin,</hi> who (be≈øides this aduice) had commandement to di≈ømi≈ø≈øe the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Lorraine</hi> Souldiers, and charge al≈øo ≈øpeedily to depart from
<hi>Lorraine,</hi> and to goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Sui≈ø≈øerland</hi> to make there a Leuy of 3000. men. Afterward, the <hi>Senate</hi> writ <hi>Letters</hi> to the
<hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine:</hi> but to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Great Britaine</hi> they gaue very many thankes, as he merited for his ready declaration to a≈ø≈øi≈øt the
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:17285:228"/> 
               <hi>Republique</hi> with forces when they ≈øhould haue need. Further, a Pre≈øent was giuen to the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall</hi> of 6000. crownes of ≈øiluer, and another to <hi>Don Francis de Ca≈øtro</hi> of 3000.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Rome</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> had aduice, how the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was accompli≈øhed, how the <hi>Cardinall de Ioyeu≈øe</hi> had trauailed therein, and the Prote≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reuoked; which did not plea≈øe him in that clau≈øe, <hi>That the Prote≈øtation was in like ≈øort reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</hi> As al≈øo it did not plea≈øe the <hi>Court,</hi> who how≈øoeuer they approued that which the <hi>Pope</hi> had done, yet they de≈øired that, according to the cu≈øtome, the end had beene with the victory of that <hi>See,</hi> which in matters of Affaires was euer wont to be the Conquerour. And indeed, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny offices and pur≈øuits were done by diuers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, and for diuers ends, to rai≈øe herein ≈øome new difficulties. But his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe</hi> abhorring the≈øe troubles, approued that which was done and writ thereof to the <hi>Cardinall de Ioyeu≈øe.</hi> And the 30. of <hi>Aprill</hi> declared in
<hi>Con≈øi≈øtory</hi> how the Accord was fini≈øhed, and Peace concluded; The
<hi>Cardinall Colonna</hi> was forward to ≈øpeake ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to the contrary, and the <hi>Cardinall du Perron</hi> an≈øwered him in few words; and nothing was ≈øaid further.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="430" facs="tcp:17285:229"/> The aduice of the Agreement being come to
<hi>Milan,</hi> the <hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> made ≈øhew that he beleeued it not, and fained to be more actiue than euer in the preparations of warre. Which he did to the end that they of <hi>Milan</hi> might not complain of the damages which they receiued, and le≈øt the Souldiers knowing that they mu≈øt be disbanded, ≈øhould make in≈øtance to be paied, e≈øpecially for that the
<hi>Germanes</hi> and <hi>Sui≈ø≈øes</hi> had couenanted to haue pay for three
<hi>Months,</hi> which would ari≈øe to the ≈øumme of 300000. crownes. In the meane while his pur≈øe was emptie, and he was indebted 50000 crownes to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>munal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for lodgings. But when the <hi>Secretary</hi> of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> (by order from the <hi>Senate)</hi> gaue him parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular notice of the Agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t, he an≈øwered cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øly, neuerthele≈ø≈øe with ≈ømall contentment, and he could not containe him≈øelfe when he was prayed from the
<hi>Pope</hi> to di≈ømi≈ø≈øe his troups but an≈øwered har≈øhly, that he knew very well what he had to doe.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Venice</hi> the <hi>Cardinall de Ioyeu≈øe</hi> being aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øed of the di≈øplea≈øure which the <hi>Pope</hi> concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by rea≈øon of ≈øome termes contained in the <hi>Manife≈øto,</hi> prayed that they would ≈øomewhat temper the matter by their <hi>Letters</hi> which the
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:17285:229"/> 
               <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> ≈øhould carry vnto the <hi>Pope</hi> and to the <hi>Cardinals;</hi> exhorting the
<hi>Republique</hi> in the Name of the <hi>King</hi> to a good intelligence with his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Rome</hi> after this there was a bruit that the <hi>Pope</hi> would not re≈øt contented with that that had pa≈ø≈øed, for that hauing weighed all things, he found that the Prote≈øtation was not reuoked by the termes of the <hi>Manife≈øto;</hi> and that hee would not endure that any
<hi>Religious</hi> ≈øhould re≈øt excluded, for as much as this was to confirme the authority of the <hi>Republique</hi> to iudge them: and therefore that hee menaced to retract all. That the <hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> did offer him 30000. men to force the <hi>Republique</hi> vnto that which he de≈øired: all which bruits a little terrified the <hi>Card. de Ioyeu≈øe.</hi> But the
<hi>Pope</hi> was far enough from any ≈øuch thoughts, on the contrary he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigned <hi>Rimini</hi> to be his <hi>Nuntio</hi> at <hi>Venice.</hi> And the <hi>Venetian Senate</hi> di≈øpatched the Lord <hi>Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini</hi> the 9 of
<hi>May,</hi> with order that he ≈øhould goe alone to Audience, le≈øt any ≈øhould thinke to lead him in triumph. Pre≈øently after his arriuall hee had Audience of his <hi>Holine≈ø≈øe,</hi> the 19. of <hi>May,</hi> where he was benignely receiued, the <hi>Pope</hi> te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying that he would neuer after remember any
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:17285:230"/> thing that had pa≈ø≈øed, taking vp that word of Scripture, <hi>Recedant uetera, noua fint omnia.</hi> Al≈øo he exhorted the
<hi>Senate</hi> ≈øince they had in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe ≈øo great an Army to thinke vpon a≈ø≈øaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Turke.</hi> There was publi≈øhed in Print a ≈øheet of paper, containing the Articles of the Accord, full of notorious forgeries, whereof the Author was thought to be the <hi>Cardinal Ca√®<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> becau≈øe it was certaine that he ≈øent many Copies to
<hi>Milan,</hi> with his Letters to <hi>Captaine Sceuerolla;</hi> which was al≈øo yet more probable, becau≈øe he was al≈øo the Author of a Di≈øcour≈øe made vnder the name of <hi>Nicomachus Philale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teus,</hi> in matter and forme much like the other. The fore≈øaid paper was carried into <hi>France,</hi> where it was prohibited by the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Mo≈øt Chri≈øtian King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 2. of <hi>Iune</hi> the <hi>Nuntio</hi> arriued at
<hi>Venice,</hi> where he was receiued according to the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie cu≈øtome.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, <hi>Don Francis de Ca≈øtro</hi> quickly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Agreement di≈øpatched a <hi>Carrier</hi> to his <hi>King,</hi> and gaue him account of what had pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, which was receiued in that <hi>Court</hi> with an extreme plea≈øure. The <hi>King</hi> thought him≈øelfe freed of a great trouble. To the <hi>Nobility</hi> it was
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:17285:230"/> very acceptable, not onely to ≈øee them≈øelues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from Warre, but further becau≈øe they hoped that this example would moderate the purcha≈øes of <hi>Eccle≈øia≈øtiques</hi> in
<hi>Ca≈øtile</hi> of ≈øuch goods as they call <hi>Patrimoniall di Radice,</hi> as they haue beene moderated in <hi>Portugall</hi> and in
<hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon:</hi> the thing being certaine that within the la≈øt 40. yeares the <hi>Regulars</hi> alone haue acquired to the ≈øumme of 250000. Crownes in goods, in that one Kingdome.</p>
            <p>After that the <hi>Currier</hi> of <hi>Don Francis</hi> was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued, came another <hi>Currier</hi> expre≈øly ≈øent by the
<hi>Senate,</hi> and carrying a commandement to their <hi>Amba≈ø≈øador</hi> to doe his complements to the <hi>King.</hi> And when the <hi>Nuntio</hi> receiued no order touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the≈øe Matters for many daies after, the
<hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lerma</hi> made great complaint vnto him, that the
<hi>Pope</hi> made ≈ømall account of ≈øo great a <hi>King,</hi> who with ≈øo much expence had maintained the authority of the <hi>Apo≈øtolique See.</hi> Order was al≈øo giuen immediatly to the <hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> that he ≈øhould di≈øarme, who either for want of money, or for ≈øome particular de≈øigne which he had, or becau≈øe he had a cu≈øtome not to obey the fir≈øt commandement, ≈øaying that they who are far off doe not ≈øee nece≈ø≈øities, did not di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øe
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:17285:231"/> his Companies: on the contrary, he put them vpon the ≈øhoulders and charge of the Communalties. Of which grieuance when they adui≈øed the <hi>King,</hi> praying to be ea≈øed, (the ≈øole Communalty of <hi>Milan</hi> being herein at the co≈øt of 7000. Crownes a day) the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> was forced to write againe vnto him with his owne hand, yet warily and not with ab≈øolute command, le≈øt he ≈øhould hazard his Royall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. But becau≈øe it was come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>King,</hi> that if the <hi>Count de Fuentes</hi> remained any longer in Armes, there mu≈øt needs follow ≈øome inconuenience, ≈øince he di≈øgu≈øted all the Cities of the <hi>State</hi> by meanes of tho≈øe Lodgings contrary to their priuiledges, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he pretended they owed him thanks for interrupting and violating the Priuiledges of the great City <hi>Milan,</hi> without Sedition,) they tooke a re≈øolution to command him ab≈øolutely. For they of the <hi>Councell</hi> (who did not like to ≈øee any ≈øtirs in
<hi>Italy,)</hi> con≈øidered that this Accord had not onely deliuered them from the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of a Warre full of great dangers, but was further al≈øo profitable vnto them for the Inconueniences which might haue hapned by the humors of the <hi>Count,</hi> being giddy-headed
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:17285:231"/> and hard to be gouerned, and by the
<hi>Popes</hi> incon≈øtancy, much wauering in his delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
            <p>The 12. of <hi>May, Don Inigo de Cardenas</hi> gaue aduice vnto the
<hi>Duke</hi> of this la≈øt commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment giuen to the <hi>Count de Fuentes,</hi> that hee ≈øhould pre≈øently by all meanes di≈øarme; and demanded pa≈ø≈øage thorow the <hi>Dominions</hi> of the <hi>Republique,</hi> for the <hi>Germans</hi> vnder <hi>Madruccio,</hi> to returne vnto their Hou≈øes. Which was freely granted, prouided that they ≈øhould pa≈ø≈øe in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and without Armes. 1500. of them de≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to pa≈ø≈øe by the
<hi>Gri≈øons,</hi> but the pa≈ø≈øage being denied them, they were con≈øtrained to take their way by the <hi>Lac de Garde</hi> within the
